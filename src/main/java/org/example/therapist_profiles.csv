I currently work exclusively online

I am a Psychoanalytic Psychotherapist holding an advanced accreditation with Pink Therapy as a Gender, Sex, Relationship Diversity (GSRD) therapist. A diploma with the Contemporary Institute of Clinical Sexology (CICS) in Compulsive Sexual Behaviours, accredited by the College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists (COSRT).

My core training in psychoanalytic psychotherapy was at the The Bowlby Centre in London. An istitute that focuses on John Bowlby's important theory of Attachment. I practice clinically from a position of pluralsim as I believe not one approach or one idea can support the complexity of our human experince.  

I am a full clinical member of the College for Psychoanalysis and Jungian Analysis (CPJA) a college with the United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP) and The European Association for Psychotherapy (EAP). 

I offer therapy that is relational, sex-positive, collaborative, and LGBTQi+ affirmative. My lived experience is integral to how I work. 
I draw on interventions and ideas from multiple modalities, namely, contemporary sexology, Gender, Sex, Relationship Diversity (GSRD). I will introduce ideas of Mindfulness and meditation within our work to support the difficult and challenging times in life  we all experince.  
In addition, I have been trained to work therapeutically in a trauma informed way.

I see all my clients on a one-to-one basis, and online if needed.

I have a Master’s degree from the Institute for Arts in Therapy and Education/London Metropolitan University. I graduated in 2013 and became UKCP registered in January 2014. I adhere to the code of ethics of the UKCP. I am committed to on-going professional development and have undertaken post qualification trainings such as Developmental Trauma, Therapeutic Groupwork and EMDR level 1. From these, I can offer EMDR sessions and can work with groups.

The aim of working therapeutically with children and young people is to provide support around their emotional, educational and social needs: to help them understand their emotions, their ways of relating to themselves and others, as well as to provide them with the tools to manage when feeling overwhelmed. I am always intrigued to see how children and young people take pleasure from learning about how the brain function and why we behave in certain ways, and to see how they show relief when I say that there’s no such thing as bad children or bad behaviour, as behaviour is only another form of communication!"

My practice is in London at the Centre for Counselling and Psychotherapy Education (CCPE), W2 6NE and in SE21. Alongside my private practice I also provide short term counselling to students at a London University. My previous experience has been with the charitable sectors and the NHS such as Westminster MIND, The Caravan drop-in counselling service, FreshStart Psychotherapy and The Maudsley (SLAM) NHS Trust.

My belief is that therapy offers a unique personal opportunity to explore in depth what may be troubling you. I feel that by having weekly therapy it gives you an opportunity to express your feelings in a caring, respectful and non-judgmental manner. This helps you look at and think about your situation from a different perspective.

Being an Integrative Counsellor and Psychotherapist I use a variety of different approaches, using whatever is most helpful. Together we will explore your challenges and concerns, allowing you to find new possibilities for healing, growth and change. My approach is flexible and practical, helping you find a sense of empowerment and make positive choices in your life again. I offer a space where you are accepted for who you are, listened to without judgment and with empathy.

Psychotherapy can provide the right space and conditions to explore and enable a beneficial and lasting change in our lives. We all have our own nature, and therefore experience the world, relationships with others and ourselves through our own way of being. Our work together would therefore be guided by your own unique nature, needs and goals.

I provide both long-term and short-term, once-weekly sessions to individuals age 18+ in a safe environment."

I am an Integrative Art Psychotherapist registered with the UK Council of Psychotherapy (UKCP) and Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) with 16 years’ experience working for a leading London charity and 4 years within the NHS (Guys Hospital). I work with a broad range of people, from teenagers through to older adults and am very experienced in helping clients to manage and reduce high levels of distress and mental disturbance, as well as working with clients seeking greater self awareness and creative expression.

My work style

I am warm, empathic and non-judgemental therapist, and I provide clients with an environment in which to accomplish change and personal growth. I focus on helping clients to understand their emotions, past, and relational patterns; and to explore new ways of relating to themselves and interacting with others. To enable this I combine talking based therapy with the use of creative media which guides clients to engage with their own creativity. It is my belief that everyone has a creative spark within them which when ignited acts to facilitate emotional growth.

Why art therapy?

Sometimes it can be hard to talk directly about difficulties and feelings, so communicating through another medium may be easier or more appropriate. The processes involved in image making and the images themselves can help this difficult communication. The use of art is introduced gradually, aiming to provide clients with an opportunity to discover themselves on a deeper level while providing a necessary emotional safety and containment. You definitely do not have to be ‘good at art’ to benefit from it.

Duration of the treatment

There is no fixed duration for treatment. You can come to explore a specific topic or to explore yourself on a wider level. No decision need be made at the start of the process and short-term work can be very useful for a particular problem. In either short or long term therapy, I regularly offer and invite feedback."

Alongside my independent practice, I then worked as a Professional Adviser for Young Minds, the child and adolescent mental health charity, providing phone consultations to over a thousand parents and carers throughout the UK where there were family members of concern.

As well as meeting face to face, since the onset of COVID, I have found that much useful work may be undertaken online. I am available to undertake both ongoing and one-off Zoom/telephone therapy and consultations. New opportunities have arisen. For instance, I have worked with an adult child and their parent who were living on different continents and with couples living abroad. Through negotiation, I am also available to undertake home visits where I will meet with family members where they live.

A specialist area that may not be comfortably worked with by some other therapists includes the wide range of complex or special needs (including autism, other issues relating to neurodiversity, physical and learning disabilities). This may include providing therapeutic support to parents, carers, siblings and other family members living with complex needs; addressing issues that arise within the wider support network; or education-, school- and work-based difficulties; and working cross-culturally. I have, for instance, had many years of experience of working with those from Muslim; African-Caribbean and African backgrounds.

I hope to work in a non-judgmental way, in equal partnership with clients to draw out their strengths and resilience in the face of often adverse and unfair experiences. Whilst acknowledging my experience and expertise, I try not to tell clients what they 'must' or 'should' do unless this is specifically requested. You are the expert on your own life and are the best judge of what is appropriate, realistic or manageable.

I offer Contemporary Psycotherapy** that is rooted in what is happening right now in your life and in the world around you. Current events may be the cause of your distress, or they may be exacerbating existing difficulties. I can help you gain understanding about the impact your past may be having on your life now and how to utilize conscious and unconscious processes to help you.
Relationships, both with ourselves and others, underpin our lives as human beings. We may use the therapeutic encounter to think about patterns of relating with significant others in your life. Or we may use it to enquire more deeply into your inner world including your felt sense or bodily sensations in order to develop resourcefulness, creativity and flow both within yourself and with other people in your life.
I have a particular interest in the impact of life-threatening illness, bereavement and loss on individuals and couples.

**I am influenced by a number of approaches from Eriksonian Hypnotherapy, psychodynamic theory, attachment models, trauma-informed approaches and most recently Interpersonal Therapy

Not just financially or physically but emotionally. They grow up to be resilient strong happy individuals.

Then something happens that throws them off course. With the help of friends and family they work through what are difficult times and return to leading fulfilling and happy lives.

On other occasions friends and family are not enough and a little extra help is needed to put them back on track. In a case such as this Counselling can help to restore the balance.

In other cases however it is hard to be happy at all. Attachment theory tell us that for those whose parents were unable to give them the childhood and upbringing that met their changing needs, for those whose parents found it difficult or impossible to attune to them, life is one where there is little emotional resilience.

With low emotional resilience they feel they list from one crisis to another. They have relationships that cause them unhappiness and make them feel low. They feel life is really difficult and everything goes wrong for them. Their defence mechanisms, once vital for survival, are now additional problems that can make life almost too difficult to bear.

Our earliest relationships have an effect on the relationship we have with ourselves, the relationships we have with those who are important to us, and the relationship we have with society, the wider world in which we live.

Therapy in a safe environment gives the opportunity to begin to think about this relationship with self and with others. Therapy can help to gain an understanding of how we see our place in the world and why. Through a strong therapeutic alliance repair can begin."

My experience tells me through self-reflection and a solid understanding of our thoughts, feelings and intentions, we can all improve our quality of wellbeing. Through decades of working 1-2-1 with people, I understand that therapy provides a safe and supportive space that can help you grow as a person.

My passion is to help people improve their psychological wellbeing and aid them on a journey of personal growth. I believe the aim of therapy is to feel less 'half-alive'. I feel it is crucial to gain a greater self-awareness of our daily thoughts and behaviours and break the frustrating repetition that we find ourselves in time and time again.

My aim is to provide a safe and comfortable space for you to talk. I can empathise with it not being the easiest thing to admit, needing help with emotional distress but being in analysis for many years myself, I have seen the benefits of having regular open-ended therapy. I am proud and passionate to now be in the position of helping others.

I feel it’s important for my clients to be understood, so I do my best to ask only the right questions without being intrusive, allowing enough space to talk without interruption. I also want to get to know you as a person so that I can really get to see what it might be like in your shoes. Empathy is incredibly important for us all to have, even more so if you’re a therapist. I pride myself on being an empathetic person who will do my best to listen and try to understand the issues that surround your life.

Life certainly has it highs and lows which can be overwhelming at times and being overwhelmed can sometimes take over all the other aspects of our lives. I'm here, ready to work with you on understanding those moments that make you feel unhappy, fearful and alone and make sense of the ups and downs we all experience. There is light at the end of the tunnel.

As far as my approach and qualifications, I am a psychodynamically trained, qualifying with a post graduate diploma in psychodynamic theory and practice at one of London's leading clinical and academic institutions, WPF Therapy. WPF highly respected and known for its long and rigorous training to ensure I provide my clients with the highest standard of psychotherapy.
With this, I am registered and bound by the ethics of the British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP), The foundation of Counsellors and Psychotherapists (FPC), The International Association For Forensic Psychotherapy (IAFP) and the UK council for Psychotherapy (UKCP).
I also hold an voluntary position at an NHS Counselling and Psychotherapy service at a category B prison.

Each person responds to the events that happen in their lives differently. Your issue, what you would like to bring to therapy is the starting point for our work together.

Talking with a therapist can help you understand how to manage difficult feelings, problems, conflict and distress. A way of exploring and untangling thoughts and feelings. It can help you to move on with your life in a more fulfilling way. Anger management, bereavement, anxiety, depression, relationships issues, divorce, affairs and betrayal, eating patterns, child related issues and addiction are just some of the reasons for seeking therapy. You might not feel there is a specific issue, just an uneasiness and a desire to think about that.

Realising that things are difficult is the first step and you may be wondering if therapy can help. An initial session can help you see if it feels right for you at this time.

My integrative approach draws particularly upon person-centred and psychodynamic approaches as well as existential philosophies. We cannot change the past events in our lives but we can choose how we think about them and how they affect our current being. I believe we all have the ability to change and grow. Therapy is a safe space to bring issues and to think about things that maybe troubling. How much you wish to say is your choice.

Short or long-term options are available. If the problem is specific, a few sessions may be all you want (6 - 12) . Or you might like to work in a more open ended way - taking time to explore your world and perhaps thinking about the meaning of your life and your experiences. Maybe the issues you are facing have been with you for some time and you wish for a space to consider them - without knowing how long it will take.

Please contact me by phone or by email, I am happy to talk about what you are looking for and to arrange a first session.

I also offer supervision to both qualified and trainee counsellors and therapists. Individual and group supervision are available depending on your needs."

Sometimes life catches up with us, or we are caught out by something which can throw us off balance, and we might need a ‘helping hand’ to guide us through it. Over the years my work has brought me into contact with people from all walks of life who have come seeking help with a range of problems. I work in the NHS as well as privately meeting with adults, children and young people who find it hard to manage their responses to all sorts of emotional difficulties, some of which are listed below.

As a Cognitive Analytic Psychotherapist my main aim is to work collaboratively with you, at your pace, in a confidential and safe therapeutic space. During our meetings we will work together to try to understand the unhelpful patterns of relating - to yourself and others - which can keep you stuck repeating the same old cycles, with a view to adopting more constructive ways of responding and relating.

During the therapy I will use various tools to help with our understanding of what we discuss. These include a letter documenting a written reformulation of your difficulties and the co-creation of a personal diagram or map which will act as a visual representation of the patterns we identify and help to guide us in our work together. Sometimes I use creative imagery and personal or general stories to assist in understanding the thoughts and emotions connected with what you might bring for us to think about.

I am happy to discuss your needs over the phone and if we agree I will arrange an initial consultation / assessment with you which lasts about an hour. If you decide to continue, the therapy is of a fixed duration which will be mutually agreed between us within the first few appointments. A typical Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT) is between 8 – 24 sessions. Each therapy session lasts for 50 minutes and we will meet weekly.

If you prefer, I can offer shorter term work using a CAT informed approach or coaching techniques to think about a specific issue you may want help working through. Again, I am more than happy to discuss this with you at an initial consultation.

I can meet with you in person, or if you prefer, I also offer online sessions. I am generally available on Thursday mornings and will also consider early evening appointments.

I am currently only able to offer Couple therapy sessions online.

I can help couples and families to foster more fulfilling relationship by enabling them: -

• to do less of what is unhelpful and more of what is helpful in how they interact with each other
• learn skills in effective communication
• find ways of navigating their conflicts and dilemmas.

I provide a safe, non-blaming and non-judgemental space for couples and families to work through their problems and dilemmas.

When it comes to making important decisions, such as a couple deciding whether to stay together or separate, I have no agenda other than to be as useful as I can be in enabling my clients to better understand themselves, their situation, and their possibilities. This provides clients with insight and a guide for making their own important decisions.

I have expertise in helping heterosexual and LGBT couples who are experiencing: -

• Ongoing and unresolved conflicts
• Difficulties in communication
• Impact of one partner suffering from depression/other mental health issues
• Considering separation and/or divorce
• Issues around anger, abuse and/or violence in the relationship
• Challenges of having different backgrounds/cultures
• Sexual tensions/difficulties
• Understanding and moving on from infidelity
• Demands of new baby/extended family/step-children on the couple relationship

I have expertise in helping families who are experiencing: -

• Challenging, worrying and/or upsetting behaviour of a child/teenager
• Coping with new and unsettling circumstances
• Becoming a step-family
• Living with the impact of separation and/or divorce
• Impact of relocation to a new country or area of the UK.

Alongside my private practice I have worked for the NHS in adult mental health services and have many years of experience in working with couples and families where a partner or family member has experienced or is experiencing mental health difficulties such as depression or psychosis."

I offer both short term and long term work and I believe the key element to successful therapy is an enabling and trusting relationship in which you feel safe to talk.

Taking those first steps to get support for yourself can be scary, I can’t promise that therapy will be easy but I have learnt through my own experience of therapy, that by giving ourselves the time and having a safe, confidential space to talk can enable us to grow in our authenticity."

I hold Diplomas in Integrative Transpersonal Counselling and Psychotherapy from Re-Vision. This is 'counselling with a soulful perspective'. The strongest influence in the training is Jung. In this perspective, times of real difficulty or despair are seen as holding a potential for change and growth.

In our work you will be heard and witnessed. You will be able to share as much as you choose about your difficulties and the pain you may feel.

For three years I worked in the student counselling service of my local university. One theme I noticed is that many people are still deeply affected by the divorce of their parents.

Being connected to nature is important to me. I live in the Chiltern Hills in Buckinghamshire. My home consulting room is in my garden, with views over fields and woods. I can work with clients outdoors in nature.

Before becoming a therapist, I worked as a marketing consultant in professional and financial services. I’m familiar with the tension this world creates between business success and personal life. I know the pressure it puts on building and sustaining relationships. 

I recognise and welcome diversity among my clients in all its forms, including cultural diversity, Gender Relationship and Sexual Diversity (GRSD and LGBTQIA+) and neurodiversity. 

I’m comfortable in the world of conscious sexuality and work with clients exploring their experiences and feelings around sexual identity and open relating/polyamory.

My work involves helping people to recover from psychological dis-ease and past painful life experiences through facilitating the gradual discovery and growth of each person's unique, authentic Self.



When there has been trauma or other difficult or challenging life experiences most people have to let go of parts of their authentic Self (dissociate) and adopt coping strategies in order to survive their specific circumstances as best as they can. While highly adaptive at the time, because it blocks out the pain of these experiences at the time, in later life there are often great personal costs attached to these survival-based strategies. Examples are feelings of a false sense of Self; of inner emptiness, unhappiness or depression; low self-esteem or insecurity; low frustration tolerance or anger; anxiety or fear; a sense of drifting through life without aims; addictions and cravings; eating disorders; self-destructive behaviours, and several others.



While dissociated, the pain connected to past experiences has not been able to process and therefore can frequently cause very uncomfortable symptoms, such as, sudden intrusive, overwhelming images; flashbacks and reliving experiences; nightmares; strong emotional or physical reactions; feelings of numbing or detachment; hypervigilance; safety behaviours; guilt; dissociative symptoms, such as feeling disconnected from life and several others. It is often events in daily life, such as interactions with a partner, which can bring out these symptoms.



However, situations which confront us with great inner pain, such as past trauma or abuse or a current life crisis, can move us into our process of inner growth and healing. Through my own personal and professional growth process, I have learnt that if we can move further into the pain, which confronts us, and process it, rather than trying to surpress or avoid it, we can mobilize our body, mind and soul's natural healing processes and strengthen and grow internally. This helps us 1. to transform and change those strategies which are no longer useful to us now, 2. experience and intergrate aspects of ourselves, which we have split off from in the past and 3. become increasingly more authentic, accepting, conpassionate and loving of ourselves. This, in turn, positively affects our functioning in life, including an improvement in our personal relationships, as well as, the relationship with our Self and thus enabling us to feel internally stronger, more fulfilled and content.



I have been the Clinical Director of The Oxford Development Centre Ltd, Oxfordshire's Independent Psychology Service and The Oxford Stress and Trauma Centre, which are all private, confidential, independent psychological treatment services, based on Witney, Oxfordshire for the past 12 years. There my team of specialists and I have been dedicated to providing such therapeutic work for our clients. Currently, interested clients can be seen by specialist therapists, following the above outlined approach, within my team at our specially designed therapeutic premises in Witney, Oxfordshire, or by myself in Stroud, Gloucestershire.



Our approach is to individually tailor therapy to each client's needs and their particular problems and goals. We work very collaboratively and feel that it is important for clients to feel empowered and included throughout all parts of their process of therapy. We recognize that clients need to feel safe and secure with the therapeutic relationship and need to be valued and met as unique individuals in order to benefit from therapy.



In order to achieve this, I draw on my extensive professional experience as a Clinical Psychologist, Psychotherapist and Trauma Expert (18 years) and the use of a wide range of therapeutic methods, including Cognitive Behavioural Psychotherapy (CBT), Schema Mode Therapy, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), Focussing, Energy Psychology, Mindfulness- and Consciousness-based Approaches, Holistic Western and Eastern Healing Methods, as well as, others.



Training, Qualifications &amp; Experience

My work has received media attention and has been presented at conferences worldwide.

I regard the interaction between myself and my client as a crucial way for their personal awareness to develop and for change to emerge; so I am actively engaged in what is happening in the moment, and I share this experience, helping my client's broaden their experience in their patterns.

Gestalt therapy encourages experimentation with alternative ways of being in a variety of creative ways, during which client's come to see the patterns they live by and the new possibilities available. This can be both exciting and rewarding.

My experience is with a wide range of severe mental ill-health, distressing life experiences and ongoing emotional worries; all of which have helped shape my interest and attention of the individuals I work with.

I trained as a Gestalt therapist, for individuals and groups, at the London Gestalt Centre, and hold both a Post Graduate Diploma and Masters Degree, accredited by London Metropolitan University.

I aim to provide an accepting and enlivening environment in which it feels safe to be curious about yourself, your feelings and where you are in life. People often come to counselling and therapy for help with difficulties around loss, grief, stress, change, unhappiness and relationships. Sometimes feelings can be uncomfortable or seem hard to understand. I am experienced in helping people talk about their feelings. I am non-judgemental and have a flexible approach in working with clients to find different perspectives on their lives. Therapy can help people to find clarity in situations and to grow in understanding.

I am trained as an integrative and existential psychotherapist and counsellor. Existential psyhotherapy has a particular focus on you as an individual within a world of relationships and possibilities. It can give you an opportunity to take stock and make changes. It can provide the space to explore the meanings and potential of your life and to reflect on how you might want to be.
Existential psychotherapy can give a framework in which to reflect on questions about meaning, identity and choice. It can help improve the quality of your relationship with others, with the world of which you are part, and how you feel towards and about yourself.

I work with individuals and offer both short- and longer-term therapy.
I have previous experience as a bereavement counsellor, and as a therapist working with vulnerable young people. I now work in the NHS as a psychotherapist. I trained at Regents University, London and am registered with the UKCP. I am an accredited member of the BACP and a member of The Society for Existential Analysis.

Psychotherapy can be an opportunity to talk through what feels difficult or problematic in life. Sometimes people have an idea about the nature of their difficulties, others are less sure. Talking with a therapist can help you to discover and make sense of what is leaving you feeling either stuck, lost, anxious, unhappy or overwhelmed.
Sometimes current issues can stir up feelings from the past, many of which we are not aware of, but which get in the way of us living fulfilled lives. People may have suffered varying forms of difficulties or trauma in their childhoods which may continue to cause them pain and distress as adults. People can feel they are not 'themselves', or overwhelmed with anxiety that inhibits their ability to live their lives how they really want to. People may feel stuck in unhappy relationships, not feeling able to make changes or resolve issues. People can develop behaviours or strategies to cope with their difficulties that seem to work in the short term, but which turn out to be unhelpful in the long run. As problems build, thoughts and feelings can feel increasingly worse. My aim is to work with you and together we can bring meaning to your difficulties and help you to understand why you may feel and act as you do. Gaining a further understanding of oneself can then bring about change along with increased freedom of choice.

I am an experienced clinician and I have worked as a therapist in adult mental health in the NHS for over 15 years - in London and the South West. I also offer private sessions to clients - both short-term and long-term contracts. I work from a pleasant purpose built office at my house in Portwrinkle, a lovely sea-side village on the south coast near the Devon / Cornwall border. Portwrinkle is connected by a regular bus service and is a 15 minute drive from Torpoint and within easy access of Looe, Liskeard, Saltash and Plymouth.

My Training and Approach:
In 2004 I completed a 5-year psychotherapy and counselling training at Regent's College in London, graduating with an Advanced Diploma in Integrative Psychotherapy and Counselling. My training gave me access to a range of therapeutic models, which allows me to offer the type of therapy that is most appropriate for the particular needs of each client. I draw on person-centred, psychodynamic, existential and attachment models in my practice. I have done extensive further post-graduate training over the years and my practice is also influenced by Compassion Focussed Therapy and Mindfulness. I am also trained in EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing), which is an effective model for reducing symptoms of trauma. I see clients with a wide range of personal, emotional and relationship issues and more complex mental health problems. My experience also includes EAP work (referrals via Employment Assistance Programmes), working in a Family Therapy Team, facilitating therapeutic groups and providing individual and group supervision.

My Aim as a Therapist:
I offer a safe, confidential and non-judgmental therapeutic space in which you can talk freely about your difficulties. My aim is to support and encourage you to clarify your thoughts and feelings in order to gain self-awareness and insight and re-connect to your inner resources and potential. Together we can focus on identifying patterns and current obstacles and gain an increased understanding of your personal priorities in order to begin to make positive changes in your life.

Over those years I've integrated many different therapy perspectives and techniques into the way I practise. I like to foster people's strengths and aim to work with them to uncover resources they may not even realise they possess. I have found that with some time to think, people can discover their own unique solutions to the difficulties they face, however deep and challenging they may be. I see therapy as a collaborative endeavour where 'no one size fits all' but it must be tailored to the individual. Above all the proof the the pudding in therapy is that the changes the person wants in their life can be seen to be happening.

Therapeutic perspectives I bring into my work are psychosynthesis, CBT and ACT, Mindfulness, creative work, Self Compassion therapy, Attachment Informed EMDR, Solutions Focused Therapy, Positive Psychology, Kiloby Inquiries, Internal Family Systems informed, psychodynamic perspectives and I've also trained in groupwork.

I also work with groups and am a qualified supervisor experienced in working in different settings. I work using 'supervisee centred supervision' being guided by the needs and wants of my supervisees and encouraging them to develop and work from their strengths. I'm also able to offer a wide variety of perspectives on client work.

I enjoy working with people short term, and can offer single sessions, brief contracts or longer term if that is needed."

I also enjoy working with trainee counsellors and therapists.

What motivates us to begin a therapy journey is as unique as we are and I strive to approach every client without preconceptions, regardless of age, sexual identity, gender, belief systems, levels of ability, ethnicity or cultural and social background.

I have been told by clients who have finished counselling that they felt safe enough to tell me what was bothering them, that they have gained self confidence and that they feel able to move forward in life with more tools. Counseling can benefit you in many ways, and sometimes just having the space just for you to talk helps in itself.It takes a lot of courage to make the first step in reaching out for support, but I will not judge you instead I will sit along side you and work together with you to find a way forward.

Why is it, in our modern times with an emphasis on immediate and constant communication, we seem to experience less genuine connection with each other? Are we forgetting or perhaps even avoiding to connect with what matters the most, our own authentic self?

Instant connectedness has come to replace reflectiveness and introspection, leading to a loss of intimacy with self and others. Therapy addresses the essential need to stop, check in with ourselves, identify and process our thoughts and feelings. It promotes connection with our own vitality.

About me

I am a qualified integrative psychotherapist and counsellor, practicing in Milton Keynes and Olney. I have a flexible, sensitive, relational approach. Over the course of our sessions, I will work very much in collaboration with you to understand what’s troubling you and formulate a treatment plan.

I focus on your presenting difficulties in the context of your early relationships and environment, helping you to create links between past and present to bring about a deeper and more cohesive understanding of yourself.

I support and encourage ways of contacting your own inner experience, the embodied felt sense of what it means to be you whilst building a trusting therapeutic relationship. Engaging in therapy can help you reconnect with a sense of aliveness, contentment and find more creative ways of participating in the world.

The core of my practice rests in relational psychoanalytic thought and humanistic-existential philosophy with its emphasis on the joy, pain and complexity of simply being human.

I offer both short-term work (up to 12 sessions) with specifically agreed goals as well as long-term (open-ended) for those who would like an in-depth exploration of their problems and a more stable change in their sense of self."

I am a Specialist Psychotherapist for Musicians.

Does any of this sound familiar?
Your life— your music— feels heavy. You’ve spent months— maybe even years feeling ‘off’ and you’re ready to get to the bottom it.

Sure, call yourself a musician– you’re just not sure who that person is anymore

You’ve done everything you were ‘supposed to do’ to ‘make it’, only to realise you’re still feeling unfulfilled, dissatisfied and empty

You’re struggling to process painful past experiences and you’re ready to move forward with healing and clarity

Therapy with me is a place where you can let go of the masks you wear as a high functioning artist and explore what it means to be fully human.

My advanced training in music performance, Transactional Analysis (TA) Psychotherapy and effective treatment planning means that I have the experience you need and deserve when healing from your past. Alongside my work in psychotherapy, I have been working in the music industry for 30+ years as a professional performer, academic and educator.

From Bollywood’s electric energy to Buenos Aires’ passionate tango halls and London’s esteemed conservatories, my musical career has traversed continents and embraced diverse genres. My experiences mean that I’ve been equipped to help some of music’s biggest names navigate the creative roadblocks and personal complexities of their careers.

No matter your level, musical style or background, my vast experience fuels my respect for your artistry and the unique path that you, as a musician walk.

Someone who really understands what you’re going through:

I happen to speak fluent musician. You won’t have to explain things like the effect of your mental health will have on auditions, touring, family guilt, practice pressure, financial pressures, teaching-burnout and the high expectations laid upon you to be a musician in today’s world. Trust me— I get it.

Your diverse story is welcome here

Bring all of yourself, no edits needed– even the parts that are feeling sticky, frayed or hidden. My journey, too, is a mosaic of distinct identities (Latina, female, expat, mother, daughter, sister, therapist, musician, teacher) and I fully bring all parts of my self in this space. Every piece, every shadow and light have a place in our work together, alongside all the other vibrant pieces that make you, you.

I am also a member of the Royal Society of Musicians.

If you are feeling low, anxious or stuck and unable to change things yourself, or repeating difficult or destructive patterns of behaviour, working with and talking with someone not involved in your life can really help. If you are struggling to cope with how life is at the moment or with something from the past, then getting support from me is the first step to feeling supported and heard and looking at how we can work together to help you make changes in behaviour, relationships, communication and ways of thinking and processing what you are facing. Your emotional and mental well-being matters and you don't have to struggle alone.

I welcome and work with clients from a diverse range of cultures, communities, and backgrounds. I believe an intersectional lens is vital in supporting individuals and I work relationally to help clients feel seen, heard, supported and empowered.

I have experience in helping people with concerns such as: Anxiety, depression, relationship difficulties, low self-esteem, grief, trauma, addiction and suicidal thoughts. I also work with an international collective supporting women and families with maternal/paternal and perinatal issues.

Prior to working as a counsellor and psychotherapist I worked in the charity sector and spent over 10 years working for a London Hospice, supporting patients and families.

I am registered with EATA and UK Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP) whose code of ethics I abide by.

In recent years, my private practice has focussed on working with people in positions of senior leadership in commercial organisations, government, education, and in the third sector. A second area of my specialist work has been working with people identifying or diagnosed as having high-functioning autism and other neurodivergent thinking styles.

I use Transactional Analysis (TA) in psychotherapy, and this approach provides broad scope to adapt the therapy sessions to meet individual needs and preferences. I'm also endorsed by the European Association for Transactional Analysis to train and supervise psychotherapists, and I'm Director of Training at The Wyvern Institute of Psychotherapy & Counselling in Bristol. My work as a TA psychotherapy trainer ensures I continue to develop my knowledge, understanding and skill as a psychotherapist, which enriches the therapy I provide and brings greater benefit to people I meet with.

However sometimes these habits and beliefs are no longer useful and can become hurdles, preventing us from progressing.

I provide a space where all of you will be received with warmth and understanding. A space where we can work together to find clarity to help you understand your struggles and find a more stable and satisfying everyday life.

About me:
I’ve been practicing as a therapist since 2013 and have worked in many different settings, including schools, universities, voluntary organisations and a GP surgery.  I have worked successfully with people of different ages and backgrounds, presenting with a range of issues including, but not limited to, anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, loss, abuse, and relationship difficulties. More generally, I’ve been working in psychological well-being for 15 years, running therapeutic art workshops and as a university mental health mentor.
It is from my own life experiences that I have been drawn to work as a therapist as I know therapy can lead change and towards a life that’s more open, connected and satisfying.

Why therapy?
People come to me for a variety of reasons; you might be feeling stuck, unfulfilled, or like life isn’t going the way you want it to. Perhaps you – or your relationships – are suffering because of unhelpful patterns that no longer serve you. You may be experiencing sadness, anxiety, loss, anger, or the effects of childhood trauma. Or perhaps you can’t put your finger on what’s wrong, but you know something’s just not right.

You may feel like you’ve tried everything, are feeling overwhelmed or that you can’t go on. I strongly believe that talking openly with an experienced, warm and non-judgmental therapist can make a significant difference to many people’s lives.

You needn’t suffer or struggle alone.

What to expect?
Our first contact is likely to be by email or a short phone call. This will give us chance to introduce ourselves and arrange an initial appointment. The first appointment will be an opportunity for you to say what brings you to therapy, see if I'm the kind of person you feel comfortable opening up to and for me to see if I will be the right therapist for you.

After this session you can decide if you want to continue working with me and from there we will find a mutually convenient time to meet each week.

I really understand the courage it takes to talk about aspects of yourself that you might find painful or embarrassing, and I’ll respect and support you without judgment. Sometimes I might challenge you too, but only as a way of moving your therapy forwards to help you get more from it. I’ll help us build a relationship that’s safe, trusting and always appropriately boundaried.

My approach:
In a safe environment and with genuine sensitivity, I’ll give you the opportunity to share and explore whatever it is you bring; including those aspects of yourself, or your life, that you feel embarrassed of or wish you could disown.

Sessions will be directed by what is of most importance to you; I have no agenda to the outcome of our work together.

As a Gestalt psychotherapist, I'll work with the whole of you (your thoughts, beliefs, emotions and your physical experiences) to help develop a deep awareness of your struggles, where they come from, and how they play out in your life and relationships.

Whilst we can explore your past to see how it influences you now, the basis of our work will be to see how you are living in the present, and how we relate to each other.

At times when it's difficult to  discuss certain events or painful feelings, we can experiment with using different creative approaches to enable you to express make sense of your experiences.

I do not offer advice and believe you are the expert of your life. I see therapy as a way of you finding and uncovering your answers and truths to create choice and flexibility in what you do and how you respond in life."

My aim is to offer clients a warm and accepting space where they can learn self-compassion, self-awareness and self-acceptance. I decided to re-train as a psychotherapist, following a long and rewarding career as a social worker. The theoretical approaches I use when working with clients are person-centred and experiential psychotherapy and EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing Psychotherapy.  My passion for this modality began following my own experience as a client.  My own life has been rich and insightful, allowing me to realise that it is normal for people to encounter difficulties in their lives, at some point.  During these times, intervention in the form of counselling/psychotherapy can create movement for clients.  I have a strong belief in people’s individual capacity to implement the necessary changes in their lives, during times of anxiety, stress and depression, if the right support is in place.

I create work-life balance by taking time to do some of the things I love, like going to galleries, running, following sport, practising yoga, reading, watching films, listening to music and walking in the countryside.

Areas of Interest:
• Key current specialisms include, working with social anxiety; anxiety in the workplace; conflict in the workplace; relationship with food; trauma; attachment; emotional abuse; working with students in higher education struggling with the academic process.

Theoretical areas of interest include:
• Mutuality/partnership working; working at relational depth with clients; client autonomy; client empowerment; identity; diversity. 
• I have a genuine interest in working with difference and diversity, and also actively enjoy working with people from other cultures. [Please note that, regretfully, at present I am unable to provide wheelchair access.] 

Research Interests:   
• I have completed research, drawing on/including the following themes:
• Working mutually to support clients to manage anxiety.
• How clients’ experiences of attachment relationships might impact on the experience of psychological contact in the therapy room.

Other practice based experience:
• I previously worked as a psychotherapist at Nottingham Trent University and at Nottingham Women's Centre.
• Being employed as a social worker for 13 years meant that I employed a number of different therapeutic modalities to work in partnership with adults, children, young people and families. They included, Person-Centred Therapy; Cognitive Behavioural Therapy; Psychodynamic Theory/Therapy; Systemic Therapy; Solution Focused Brief Therapy; Crisis Intervention; Task Focused methods; Attachment Theory and several others.

It can be comforting to confide in someone independent of your friends and family, a neutral figure capable of comprehending your experiences and guiding you through the intricacies of your thoughts and emotions.

In my practice, I aim to provide a secure, supportive, and confidential space that exists outside the realm of your everyday life. This environment is dedicated to allowing you the freedom to discuss and delve into the matters on your mind. Together, we will collaborate to establish a therapeutic setting that nurtures personal transformation and growth.

My approach to therapy is multi-dimensional, drawing inspiration from developmental theory, relational psychoanalytic theory and interpersonal neurobiology. By integrating these perspectives, I strive to unite the mind, body, and brain, ensuring that every facet of your experience is acknowledged and understood. This approach underscores my commitment to guiding clients in exploring their humanity, fostering transformative change and personal development.

As a seasoned and accredited clinical integrative psychotherapist and counselling psychologist with the UKCP, I offer individual sessions tailored to your needs, whether on a short- or long-term basis. Together, we can decide on the most suitable approach for our collaborative journey."

I have experience in running groups, managing trainees and working one -to- one therapeutically. My work is very diverse, as are my clients, and I am passionate about working to help children, young people and families to feel better about themselves and themselves in relation to others and the outside world. This is done in the context of an empathic therapeutic relationship in a safe, caring and confidential space. Part of the work can be using image, metaphor, play, the arts and the body. This helps to gain self-awareness and healing with children and young people with various issues.



I believe that each child and young person has a unique way of seeing things and try to work from their

perspective. As an integrative psychotherapist, I can work using different approaches to meet the

needs of the young person in the therapy. This means that I can contain and apply ways of working

through issues, which will enable the child to integrate and help to live life to their fullest potential.

The arts can be a useful tool and way of doing this, as they can help to externalise issues and then look

at them in a subjective way.



I have experience working with children and young people with various issues affecting their well-being such as trauma, abuse, depression, anxiety, phobias, panic attacks, anger issues, obsessive compulsive behaviour, low self-esteem, loss and bereavement, self-harm, problems in intimacy, Autism, Asperger’s and ADHD. I also have wide experience working with children and young people who present challenging behaviour.



I have experience in supporting staff in schools, and run groups, to help enable staff to process

difficulties they face in relation to child protection issues and in looking at different approaches to

ways of working in the classroom.



I am UKCP registered and a member of BACP.

I am a clinical Supervisor, supervising therapists working with children, adolescents and adults."

Having trained and practiced as a social worker prior to qualifying as a psychotherapist I bring multi-dimensional perspectives to thinking about families. I currently work for an internationally renowned children and young peoples’ mental health charity, act as a visiting lecturer at UCL, and operate an online private practice for couples and families.

In my private practice I offer short and long-term support for adults, couples, parents and families (not children or adolescents individually).

I am keen to work with all people, whether you need guidance negotiating challenges in your relationships, or are looking for support as you move through life transitions. I have particular interest in working with people looking to adopt, couples experiencing perimenopause or menopause, and LGBT+ families.

My experience spans a range of different settings. At schools I have supported children in social care and also provided key mental health services, working with children and adolescents individually, and also with parents and families. Additionally, I have worked with senior leadership teams within schools to consider the culture of mental health and the whole school approach, and have supported staff through implementation of change. In the NHS I have worked in the Child and Adolescent mental health service (CAMHS) and also an adult family therapy clinic. Additionally, I provide support to Foster Carers and Social Workers to reflect on children who are looked after and their best interest when making life changing decisions.

How to work with me

My process for taking on new clients is to begin with a 20-minute phone call where we can discuss the difficulties you are seeking help with, my approaches to therapy, and whether I am the right psychotherapist for you.

I aim to work with you to create a space that is safe, honest and purposeful.

Currently I am only working online via Doxy.me (no account needed)"

I have a private practice in Brighton, and trained at The Institute for Arts in Therapy and Education (IATE). Integrative Arts Psychotherapy is humanistic and essentially a relational collaborative way of working to facilitate our capacity to heal. I work with Attachment, psychodynamic theories, Gestalt, TA, and the arts, including the body to safely locate and integrate emotions. My approach is trauma informed and I am a qualified EMDR therapist. Trauma is often accumulative and sometimes people experience a 'last straw' moment after a number of events throughout life eg feeling vulnerable through illness, extreme stress, or a major loss.

I offer a confidential, safe, professional environment for individual sessions where you can share, explore, and reflect on emotional, mental, and behavioural issues that you may be finding troubling or difficult to work through.
I understand therapy can be a troubling and daunting experience with each person's needs and expectations being unique and I work sensitively to accommodate and be present to what is being presented.
My approach is warm, compassionate, and collaborative, being based on the understanding that living a more contented life begins when you focus your energy inward, revealing processes which are out of your current awareness and yet seem to exert tremendous control over your life.
With this in mind, I draw on my therapeutic creativity and other modality influences to inform our work together, enabling a collaborative experience to evolve which is both creative and relational, whether our approach is from a psychotherapy or blended therapeutic-coaching perspective.
My work has included adult therapy and working in a Primary and Secondary school setting both in the UK and in South Africa with individuals, adult groups and also in school settings.

I work with clients for open-ended and time limited sessions. How long we will work together will depend on what you are looking to gain from our sessions and what feels right for both of us
I offer an initial intake session which begins the process of exploring your present situation and discussing your needs in a relaxed environment. During this time we can take a closer look in more detail at what you are looking for form our time together. It will give you an opportunity to meet me in person, ask questions and see if working with me feels right for you at this time.
I currently work in private practice and the voluntary sector.

Gaining a perspective on our lives gives us an awareness and understanding of ourselves from which choices towards change can occur.

Sometimes knowing who you are, gives you the compassion, and the freedom to accept yourself and open up a more emotionally healthy future. Integrative Psychotherapy is a talking therapy that takes account of theories of psychology, therapeutic methods, and current developmental theory. When words are difficult Art offers a means to access feelings and emotions non-verbally. I work as an art therapist with individuals when specifically requested and also with groups with special needs"

As a fully registered and accredited UKCP Psychotherapist and a registered member of the BACP, I have a vast experience of various concerns in private, NHS and public clinics. My varied experience has permitted me to meet a diverse spectrum of clients with varied backgrounds and presenting concerns
It may be that you find yourself censoring your feelings and communication with others for fear of burdening them or being judged. Otherwise, you may wish to find a therapist to help you to explore hard to talk about subjects, thoughts or histories.

My consulting room is based on the principles of mutual trust, connection, commitment and respect. Together, we can safely and effectively consider anything you wish to share leaving you less burdened and improving your wellbeing.
My Integrative approach to Psychotherapy, has provided me with an extensive foundation of perspectives and psychological philosophies.

I have consolidated my experience within my family therapy practice to work relationally alongside families irrespective of their circumstances. My aim is to harness and facilitate both individuals and family’s resilience to embrace and become their own agents of change.

Within this context I am experienced in working with the symptomatic behaviour that relational trauma can bring. This can manifest in anxiety, low mood, self-harming, challenges with emotional regulation, aggressive behaviour and impulsive risk-taking behaviours. My systemic interventions use strength-based attachment relational interventions. I am influenced specifically by Emotion Focused Therapy, Dyadic Developmental Therapy, Theraplay, Attachment Narrative Therapy, Functional Family Therapy and None Violent Resistance (NVR) models.

I am aware that the family system has the potential to offer mediation and repair for emotional and behaviour difficulties, but that equally it can contribute to existing challenges through toxic behaviour often triggered by shaming and blaming narratives."

I did an additional qualification for 2 years in Psychosexual and Relationship Therapy and my practice now also has a real focus on Couples, Individuals and Relationships. I work with adults so it makes sense where it is relevant sex and relationships need to be understood and talked about, they often sit at the centre of your happiness.

I encourage people to pick up the phone and speak to me, because therapy is a relationship, you need to feel safe with me, comfortable to talk about uncomfortable things, and there needs to be trust, even if it's something you struggle with. It takes time, but don't be scared about that, I am not the therapist who wants you to still be working with me in a decade (unless that's what you want/need). I will always flag when I think we are ready to end our work. This podcast with video can give you a flavour of my work with couples and relationships https://open.spotify.com/episode/4MQyGMMLgiL3PpUpRY6cKO?si=n3eyo1u7TPqvxWd8espGcA

Before I trained as a therapist I used to do 18 hour days in a commercial role. Ironically it's not that different, you get used to listening to what people want and need and trying to help them achieve what they are seeking. Like many of my clients, but not all, I did a full on job, alongside having kids and juggle kids alongside my work for a long time so I get the stresses and strains on individuals and couples.

It can be overwhelming trying to choose a therapist. A quick chat on the telephone before we meet is often a good place to begin. This gives a sense of who I am and might help you feel more comfortable about meeting me and working together. It's also a chance to get a sense of what you can expect. Therapy is really determined by a few factors, and absolutely fundamental to the outcome is not just your engagement, but the relationship built with your therapist. Being comfortable to talk, reflect and think about things that are often far from comfortable is part of the work. The way I work is to be a real human, which means I am capable of laughter as well as being there when you are struggling, and also when it's needed challenging you in a way that allows you to feel safe, and to think about the challenge with me.

We all have times when we don't want to know, see or hear things, but my motivation is entirely driven by experience. I cannot ask you to believe in something I don't and I don't believe in things unless I have seen or experienced them. What I have learned about therapy is it can be a waste of money or with the right combination of people, therapy can be a form of human alchemy and can create lasting evolution. This does not mean you will stop being a human, all your flaws will fall away and all relationships will be idyllic and without problems, but it can mean you feel more equipped to cope, understand yourself and others better and process situations more calmly . I am a massive believer that no-one else gets to define your self worth, our job is for you to know who you are, where you begin and end, and absolutely know innately what your value is.

I encourage people to pick up the phone and speak to me, because therapy is a relationship, you need to feel safe with me, comfortable to talk about uncomfortable things, and there needs to be trust, even if it's something you struggle with. It takes time, but don't be scared about that, I am not the therapist who wants you to still be working with me in a decade (unless that's what you want/need).

Like many of my clients, but not all, I did a full on job, alongside having kids so I understand the different pressures many of those I work with are under. Also I know what it's like to step out of a career that was a big part of my identity and start again. I am driven and focussed to help my clients end up in a place that feels better to them than where they began, and this approach is not just informed by hope and positivity but experience. I can't say something I do not believe, and I cannot believe something unless I have experienced it personally or witnessed it. I love what I do."

Many people can go through life just fine and suddenly realise one day that coping mechanisms aren’t working anymore, and something needs to change.

Can you be curious about yourself?

If so, then psychodynamic psychotherapy may work for you. By using the unique therapeutic relationship to explore links between past and present, inexplicable difficulties with everyday life, relationships, work or transitions can often be understood by revealing the influence of previous experiences. Speaking about these in a safe place with a trained professional can offer short-term relief, as well as a foundation for lasting change.

I am a qualified Forensic Psychotherapist, meaning that I’m trained to work with some of the most disturbed minds and difficult behaviours encountered in the criminal justice system. This work is carried out in specialist NHS and secure settings, but I bring these skills and knowledge to my practice with private clients, which means I can offer both compassion and challenge where it’s most helpful. It also means I have experience working with traumatic histories and the darkest of thoughts. And through my voluntary work, I regularly speak with people who feel overwhelmed, tending to self-harm and having suicidal thoughts.

Qualifications

My university degree, MSc Psychotherapy, and specialist clinical training at the Tavistock & Portman Clinic means that my practice meets the highest standards of psychodynamic psychotherapy, as accredited by the British Psychoanalytic Council (BPC), where I am a full registrant. I’m also a member of the Tavistock Society of Psychotherapists; an accredited member of the United Kingdom Council of Psychotherapists (UKCP); and a member of the British Association of Counsellors and Psychotherapists (BACP). This essentially means you can be sure of the quality of my work and that I adhere to the ethical codes of practice required by all these professional bodies.

Most importantly, this means that I’ve spent several years in therapy myself, as is required by all formal psychotherapy trainings. I have learned how therapy can give freedom, promote balance and help realise true potential."

I provide a safe and confidential space where you can work with me in your own time and at your own pace to resolve personal issues, review coping strategies, change unhelpful patterns of behaviour, increase self-awareness, improve self esteem and learn to live and relate more healthily and more creatively.

Therapeutic work involves listening actively and creatively, supporting you to reflect on your experience and unravel and find expression for thoughts and feelings that can feel stuck, confusing, in a muddle, distressing or disturbing. It can also be a place for looking at immediate issues in a new light.

The way we work will depend on the issues you want to talk about. A key element will be the therapeutic relationship that grows between us. For this to happen successfully, it is important to build a strong sense of trust that whatever you want to talk about will be received and responded to sensitively and productively.

Speaking about difficult thoughts, feelings and experiences is not always easy. Therefore we will work together to support you to talk freely and openly, gain a better, deeper understanding and acceptance of who you are, and find new and more effective ways of responding to personal situations and circumstances that may be unrewarding, unsatisfying and perhaps a cause of distress.

At present, I work one-to-one and offer face-to-face and, in particular circumstances, telephone sessions. I also offer counselling and other support within organisations. Issues I work with include depression, anxiety, stress, bereavement, problems in relationship and anger management. I offer both longer- and shorter-term psychotherapy and we can talk about what approach might be more suitable for you as part of the initial assessment that we will complete together.

If you have any questions or want to find out more, by all means call, email or text me, whichever is best for you.

I look forward to hearing from you and speaking with you."

While my approach is eclectic to meet the needs of each client I believe that the therapeutic relationship is the foundation for clients to develop their sense of self that enables emotional resilience."

I'm an individual and group psychotherapist in a GP surgery and in private practice, an honorary psychotherapist for Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health Trust, and a registered psychotherapy practitioner with the British Association for Performing Arts Medicine (BAPAM) and Help Musicians UK Music Minds Matter.

My style is warm and empathetic. Sessions can feel reflective, with two-way dialogue; other times playful and creative. My aim is not to interpret or define you, but to support you to define yourself. Where appropriate, I incorporate creative aspects such as drawing, music, movement, dream, object and chair work. I don't give advice but focus on getting to the crux of your underlying feelings when you remove society's expectations from the picture.

I'm the author of 'How to Understand and Deal with Stress', published by Summersdale/Hachette, and a freelance journalist specialising in music and mental health. I'm the founder, host and producer of the music and mental health podcast Sound Affects, featured in NME's 'Podcast for the People' series. I appear in the press and media on therapy/mental health related issues and spent many years working in magazine, newspaper and journal publishing.

Prior to becoming a therapist, I was a Samaritans helpline listener for 4 years, supporting people with suicidal feelings. I also worked for Samaritans as a copywriter during their male-suicide research campaign, my banners for which appear across the London tube and nationwide railway network. I have lots of empathy in this area. I also worked as a life coach for vulnerable Looked After children leaving care for MIND, a university counsellor for Regent's University, and a mental health mentor for London Met University."

I work within the humanistic integrative philosophy which means I see us all as having a tendency towards wholeness, growth and healing given the opportunity. I see my role as providing that opportunity, by offering you a real, safe and trusting therapeutic relationship.

My aim is to provide you with an empathic balance between support and challenge so we can explore and confront whatever feels relevant to you, in the now and in the past.

My interest in this work has a freshness and vitality, and I welcome your unique self and challenges. I have always been interested in how we, as humans, organize ourselves driven by instinctive needs, and how different conditions mean we adapt ourselves to the world differently – my early interest started on this broader level of country, culture and religion, leading me to gain a BAHons in Social Anthropology within the school of African and Asian Studies (Sussex University). I grew up in a number of west, east and southern African countries, as well as south Asia, but settled in England in my mid-20s having come here to study Social Anthropology. I have a continued interest in diversity, privilege and oppression.

I spent some years off this path, as a marketing manager, eventually returning and focusing on the more personal level of how we as humans develop within our family, family culture and experiences, leading me to working for Home Start Stroud District supporting families in crisis, with children under 5.

I trained for 4 years as a Psychotherapeutic Counsellor at Bath Centre for Psychotherapy and Counselling, gaining a distinction in Humanistic and Integrative Counselling. I understand what it is like to be the client, and not the therapist - my training required me to have personal therapy during my 4 years of study.

I have been working as a Psychotherapeutic Counsellor since 2017, in various settings (The Low Cost Counselling Service in Bath, as the Stroud counsellor for Carers Gloucestershire, at Cotswold Counselling, up to the present day where I work privately as well as for a counselling practice in Stroud).

I am proud to have gained membership as a fully accredited Psychotherapeutic Counsellor with the UKCP. This membership reflects rigorous training, ethical practice and a commitment to extensive and continued learning and training.

This business of 'being human' never loses its interest for me; I will be attentive to your humanity, uniqueness, and personal challenges."

I have been described as an empathic, warm, and compassionate Psychotherapist. I work with clients to explore the underlying aspects of themselves they may not always be aware of, to understand how they see themselves, how they deal with others and see the world. I work with clients to understand why they keep behaving or thinking in a particular way, or why certain things keep happening to them (for example repetitive patterns in relationships).
I work with clients so that together we can try to understand the influence past experiences in life have had on them and how it impacts them in the present day. I believe that when a client has awareness of this, they can move towards changing these patterns of behaviour.
I have experience of working with clients with a range of presenting issues including working with traumatic events, both cumulative and single events, anxiety, low self-esteem, stress, lack of confidence, struggling with decision making, grief, relationship issues, transitions.

Following a long-term passion for the outdoors, I also organise residential workshops and retreats, aimed at facilitating personal development, overcoming challenges and healing past wounds in a transformative space so generously offered to us by nature. During those events people from different walks of life can 'get away from it all', reflect on a particular issue, listen to their inner voice or just enjoy the surroundings and quality time we so rarely allow ourselves to experience.

Embracing the Renaissance ideal of developing oneself as a whole, I studied a variety of subjects, from English studies (MA) to business administration (MBA), psychology (MSc) and psychotherapy (Dipl. PW). Over several years I have gained experience in academic, healthcare and business environment, which I find extremely useful for my current facilitating, coaching and training work. While in Edinburgh, I also co-operate with non-government organisations on social and cultural projects, which often involve working with community groups and promoting empowerment and inclusion based on Deep Democracy principles. For the last few years I have been also running a successful business coaching practice.

The most frequent issues I explore with clients relate to stress, lack of motivation, feelings of emptiness, lack of purpose in life, anxiety and depression, relationship problems, low self-esteem, imposter syndrome, inner critic, personality clashes, conflicts, procrastination, middle-age crisis, burn-out and setting priorities in life (I call it ‘setting priorities’ although it is often referred to as 'achieving a ‘work-life balance’, for me however, there is a difference).

One of my passions is helping others to unfold their Life Myth, a story that is trying to happen through their lives. Exploring it enables people to gain more awareness of their potential and re-establish connection to themselves, other people, nature and the world. They may see their relationship issues, psychosomatic symptoms and childhood dreams in a new light and gain valuable insights from those encounters. The journey can happen individually, though most people prefer to attend one of my residential workshops, during which we go through a number of activities including exercises, nature walks and individual reflections. As a result, the participants can frequently find more meaning in their personal life and at their workplace, getting closer to their inner direction or 'calling' and finding which step do they want to take from there.

If you have a question about my sessions or workshops, you're more than welcome to visit my website or contact me via email or on the phone."

It's not easy to choose a psychotherapist or counsellor so take your time.
I have worked as a psychotherapist and counsellor for over 25 years and remain passionate about my work and the transformation and change it can bring to peoples' lives. I have witnessed so many people change during therapy and reach the goals they want.
I work with individuals; adolescents, young adults, older adults as well as couples. I also see parents for parental consultations. I also do EMDR.
You, the client are always at the center of any therapy I do. I adapt the way I work dependent on what you need and want from the therapy. I may guide you, provide you with helpful tools, techniques and strategies if that is what you need and want. I am there for you.
You may feel you want a space to reflect, think about and explore what is going on in your life. Maybe you've come to therapy to try and work through some difficulties from the past or make sense of what's happening in your life currently. Maybe you're not sure what you want from therapy but you know you want to talk to someone who is outside of your situation, non-judgmental, empathetic and confidential.
I am here for you, to listen to you and what you need in a non-judgmental, confidential setting. This is a space where you will be listened to and heard and together we will work out what you need and what will help you.
I work with a variety of psychological and mental health issues; trauma, abuse, depression, anxiety, relationship, couple and family issues.
I have had a private practice for many years and work both online, using Zoom, and in-person, out of my premises in Chiswick and Kensington, West London.
I also work at a university; the LSE, where I have been providing therapy to students and staff for over 19 years.
I also work at Jewish Womens' Aid where I provide therapy to women who have experienced coercive control, domestic abuse and sexual violence.
At the university I facilitate a variety of groups and workshops in Perfectionism, Procrastination, Low Self-Esteem, Stress Management, Anxiety, Good Self-Care. I have been running a Bereavement Group for students for over seven years.
I also offer a fast and effective type of therapy called EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) Therapy. This works very effectively by lowering the distress levels of most psychological and mental health issues and conditions; from anxiety and depression to trauma and abuse.
In the past I have worked at The Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre, The Richmond Fellowship (a therapeutic community for those with severe mental health problems), for MIND, at Turning Point, in primary and secondary schools (Twyford Church of England School) with adolescents and for a specialist eating disorder service.
I have lived and worked in several different countries and experienced a variety of cultures, languages and religions. I speak different languages; I am partially fluent in Polish and have a basic knowledge of Swedish, Hebrew and French.
Please do look at my website.
I wish you all the very best finding a psychotherapist/ counsellor.
Monika"

Many things can get in the way of our feeling able to be present and fulfill our true potential. Self beliefs and assumptions about life can be mostly unconscious (we don't know we have them but they inform every choice we make), having been learned from our early experiences in our family, culture and environment. If these beliefs and assumptions remain unconscious they rule our lives without our knowing it and we may wonder why we repeat negative patterns or why it feels difficult to feel content and peaceful inside ourselves. By having a safe, confidential, non-judgmental space with a qualified Psychotherapist to explore your experience through talking and/or image making, you can process any past pain and trauma so you are more free to live in the present and you can discover any limiting self beliefs based on things in the past so you can have more freedom to choose how you respond to life as it is NOW.

I offer Integrative Arts Psychotherapy (IAP). which is a psychotherapeutic approach that actively encourages the client's imagination alongside talking to facilitate exploration, change and self understanding.

Each client will require a unique approach to his or her challenges and reasons for coming to therapy. I am led by what the client brings as well as my own theoretical interests; the beauty of an integrative approach is that I can continually assess and deepen my awareness of the many ways of understanding humanness in a fluid way which keeps the client at the center of the therapeutic process.

The number of sessions will depend on you, the complexity of the issues you want to resolve and the depth of the work we undertake together.

The aim of psychotherapy is to help you to develop your awareness of why you feel the way you do about yourself and others, and how you respond to life and those around you. As a psychotherapist I aim to support you to develop better coping strategies when faced with difficult feelings, thoughts or behaviours that cause you inner conflict or conflict in relationships with others. The overarching aspiration is to enable you to enhance your life and live it more fully by making changes in the way you address your feelings, thoughts and behaviours to improve your mental and emotional well-being.

As an Integrative psychotherapist I work with a unique integrated model that is a synthesis of Humanistic Psychology, Object Relations Theory and Psychoanalytic Self-Psychology. Therapeutic approaches that inform my practice include Psychodynamic Psychotherapy, Gestalt Psychotherapy, Transactional Analysis, and Relational therapy. The influence of these different approaches enables me to work with clients with a wide variety of difficulties.

These are some of the issues I have experience of working with:
• Depression
• Confidence and self-esteem issues
• Relationship difficulties
• Domestic violence
• Histories of abuse
• Family difficulties
• Identity issues
• Bullying
• Loss and bereavement
• Cultural difference
• Issues around sexuality
• Pregnancy and fertility issues
• Anxiety

I am currently working as a Principal (senior) Psychoanalytic Psychotherapist and MBT Practitioner in NHS Secondary Care Psychological Therapy Services with individuals and groups within outer London, with a particular interest in personality disorder, attachment and trauma. I have specialised in delivering evidence-based therapy to adults experiencing symptoms of trauma, depression, anxiety, relational difficulties and loss. Currently working with clients using psychodynamic, mentalisation based treatment (MBT), eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and integrative skills.

A BIT ABOUT THERAPY
Therapy is an opportunity to explore and find words for our experiences, thoughts, feelings and behaviours; both those we are aware of and those of which we are less conscious. This can help us to process our experience, including that which is painful and traumatic.
Therapy can help us to understand ourselves; our thinking, behaviour and relationships better, thus enabling constructive change in our lives. We can move beyond stuck, repetitive and self-destructive patterns of relating to ourselves and others, to new and healthier possibilities. People who benefit most are usually those who want to understand themselves better and who have the motivation to commit to the process, even when it involves facing emotional pain. It is a process that requires working closely together to help you navigate through your current difficulties to where you would like to be and have an improved quality of life.

Psychoanalytic psychotherapy is a talking therapy based on saying whatever is going through your mind. This helps you become aware of hidden meanings or patterns in what you do or say that may contribute to your problems. Many people come to us because they feel they are trapped by their past and want to talk it through with someone.

Through understanding these connections and patterns therapy can:
-Bring relief
-Reduce confusion about what helps and what doesn’t
-Identify changes that can be made in your life
-Help you come to terms with what can’t be changed
-Psychoanalysis is based on the modern developments of the theories of Sigmund Freud. Freud believed that bad thoughts and experiences from childhood are repressed but continue to influence your feelings as an adult.

ISSUES IT CAN HELP WITH
Therapy can help with a range of psychological problems, particularly difficulties that can impact on relationships:

-Depression
-Anxiety disorders
-Relationship difficulties
-Post traumatic difficulties
-Personality difficulties

LENGTH OF TREATMENT
Therapy sessions last for 50 minutes. They usually take place once a week, but sometimes more frequently.
Patients are seen on their own at the same time and in the same room, as this consistency helps people get the most out of their treatment.

THERAPY SESSIONS
I am interested in what’s on your mind. As a session develops this includes possible feelings about our relationship. There are no expectations and you are free to talk about whatever is on your mind.

I try to understand and point out particular difficulties in talking or thinking about certain things. Although we know that it’s helpful to talk, we also know it’s not always easy. It’s important to understand what might get in the way.

RISKS AND EFFECTS
Talking and thinking about emotional problems can be difficult. For this reason some people can feel worse before they feel better. We work with you to manage strong emotional reactions.

Sometimes this kind of therapy can make people feel too angry or makes their depression worse, or some can feel too criticised. It can be painful to face the past and the truth, but this has its limits and I respect that.
I aim to provide a warm, safe confidential and non judgmental space to be able encourage change. I offer both longer-term open-ended work and brief focused therapy.
If you would like to explore the possibility of therapy or consultation, do contact me. I look forward to speaking with you."

As an integrative therapist I pay attention and really listen to the many different aspects of you and your experiences in life. This can enable you to uncover buried patterns and beliefs, which have prevented you from living a richer and fuller life.

This may be the first time you have considered counselling/psychotherapy in order to reflect on, and perhaps understand a long term issue or maybe to embark on a period of personal growth. Whatever the reason I am happy to talk through any concerns you may have.

Are you stuck in a rut in which everything makes you feel anxious? Or life feels like a deep dark hole? Therapy can help by providing compassion and support to disentangle, confront and accept some of the painful aspects that life seems to put in our way.
As a relational Gestalt therapist, I use our relationship to guide our work as we build awareness of the patterns that can keep us stuck – and by doing so, generate options for change.

Choose the right therapist for you
Research indicates that it is the relationship between therapist and client that supports the effectiveness of psychotherapy. So I believe it’s important to choose a therapist that you can feel comfortable with and that you can imagine growing to trust, even if this may take time.

How I work
In addition to my core training (a Masters degree in Gestalt psychotherapy) I’ve attended a wide range of seminars, workshops and short courses, in the UK and also the US. These have involved many different theoretical approaches including movement-based therapy, CBT and Psychodynamic. These, and other approaches, give me multiple rich insights into how we can approach our problems and difficulties.
I have a particular interest in the connection between mind and body and how we can use that to improve our wellbeing. This goes along with a life-long interest in physical and mental wellbeing, along with their flip sides of anxiety, depression, shame and trauma.

The combination of skills I offer is unique. As a registered psychotherapist, coach and mindfulness consultant (and author of The Burnout Bible), I am one of the UK's leading specialists in stress and burn-out.

I have been working with mindfulness-based approaches since the early 1990s.

In 2014 I took part in an innovative pilot scheme on Mindfulness and Weight Loss.

I have a particular interest in working with :
stress, burnout and work-life balance (with a special emphasis on the particular needs of high achieving professionals and people in creative fields)
confidence, self esteem, leadership and imposter syndrome
quality of life issues (including mid-life crisis, life goals and spiritual values)
the creative process
mindfulness
personal / professional development

I am a UKCP (UK Council for Psychotherapy) registered psychotherapist.

My qualifications include a Diploma and MSc in Integrative Psychotherapy, a Diploma, Advanced Diploma and MA in Counselling, a Certificate in Supervision, trainings in CBT, BWRT and Mindfulness. I have also trained in NLP, Focusing, Mediation and Groupwork, amongst many other things.

I have updated my skills through an Evidence-Based CBT course, which follows the recommendations of NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Guidelines) and the IAPT (Improving Access to Psychological Therapies) programme plus a Certificate in CBT.

I co-founded Eastern Tree Training and Therapy. I have also been a board member for the Association of Humanistic Psychology in Britain and on the management committee of the One-to-One Project in King's Lynn (which offers counselling and befriending).

I have worked in different mental health and therapeutic settings, supporting individuals presenting with a variety of concerns.

You may lead a good enough life, but still feel the desire to change certain aspects which are causing you some distress. It could be that you are experiencing general feelings of emptiness and a lack of purpose and/or meaning. Perhaps you cannot think clearly and compassionately about yourself, or struggle to find your voice. In a warm and non-judgemental space I will listen to you very carefully and help you uncover meanings, whilst reflecting on your patterns and choices.

I am an experienced therapist, previously worked in the City for 30 years, 13 years a therapist. I will help you to explore your life and change for the future. Ring for a chat: 0780 705 1162

The focus of the work will be to explore your concerns and issues in relationships and how you experience your life. Our objective will be to reconnect to your own process of reflection about who you are and who you want to be.

We each carry our own hopes and expectations of life but at times it can feel that life is empty and meaningless, our lives drifting and disappointing. Starting counselling and experiencing a therapeutic relationship could be the start of healing and growth and discovering a different approach to life.

Psychotherapy can help at times when we feel isolated and alone or experiencing a major life change such as bereavement, relationship concerns or depression and anxiety. Issues of sexuality/sexual abuse and gender can be discussed in a safe and non-judgemental setting.

The type of psychotherapy I practice usually takes place once or twice a week, currently in person, on Skype or the phone: I am experienced in seeing people in this way and during the pandemic I have found online or telephone work dynamic and effective, it is also a flexible solution if your work or location makes it hard for you to attend in person each week. The ongoing 50min session began with psychoanalysis, informed by the work of Freud, Lacan and others, but is adapted to the modern world. We will work together to try to understand the roots of what you are bringing to therapy and how might relate to your past and to other areas of your life.

Experience

Before training to become a psychotherapist I was an artist and arts educator. I worked creatively with people from vulnerable and hard to reach communities, enabling them to have their voices heard and their stories told through the creation of artwork.

During this time I came to understand the therapeutic and cathartic benefits of using creative techniques to explore and express oneself. This experience fueled my desire to help people on a deeper level and so I began my training to become a psychotherapist. I completed my qualification in Adult Integrative Psychotherapy at the Northern Guild for Psychotherapy in 2020. I have been in practice since 2016.

I began my practice as a therapist at the Northern Guild for Psychotherapy where I worked with a range of people both long and short term. I also gained several years experience providing training therapy to trainee counsellors and psychotherapists. In 2022 I set up my own therapy practice in the Ouseburn.

Location

I work from my beautiful and comfortable therapy room in an old school in the Ouseburn in Newcastle upon Tyne. The building and my room is accessible to all and has free parking so easy to visit.

With views of the trees out of the tall arch window, you can hear and see nature change and grow through the seasons as you go through your own therapeutic journey of change.

Booking in

The relationship with your therapist is key in this healing process so it is important to find a therapist who you feel comfortable with, and that you feel you can relate to. As it takes time to work this out I offer a free initial zoom call as our first meeting.

After this if we feel like we would be a good match we would meet for two assessment sessions where I would seek to find out in more depth about you and your life and the things you are struggling with. These two sessions also give you the opportunity to get to know how you feel working with me before making a commitment doing the deep and healing work of psychotherapy.

So if you feel like I might be the right person for you, please get in touch and ask me any questions you might have. I look forward to hearing from you."

Having initially worked with families, individuals and couples affected by substance misuse in the context of the UK National Health System, I continued my career with a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS), where I worked clinically with families when a child presented with a difficulty, as well as delivering parenting courses and supporting other professionals who worked with children.

It is difficult to put down in a brief introduction such as this, who I am and how I work in therapy with my clients, as each person I see has different needs and experiences. This idea forms the basis of my systemic approach to therapy, which focuses on how people and the difficulties they face are affected by and connected to the world and people around them.
I work with whole families, couples, children and young people, or individuals, and have experience of working with a range of issues. I have experience of working in hospital settings supporting people with mental health diagnoses such as ASD, Bi-polar, Psychosis; providing therapy in an out-patient service for difficulties such as self-harm, eating issues, relationship difficulties and family breakdown, and work independently with those who self-refer for help in areas such as bereavement, anxiety, depression and stress.

It is hard to list all of the areas with which I can offer therapy, as I would say my main specialism is simply people (although in my experience people are far from simple!), and I would encourage anyone who is considering therapy to contact me and discuss how I might be able to help them with their particular unique set of needs.

I like to work collaboratively with my clients, finding the best possible way of working through whatever the issue is which has brought them into therapy, and relish the challenge of adapting to each different family I meet and finding a way forward together.

I qualified as a Systemic and Family therapist in 2012 and am a registered member of the Association of Family Therapy and the UKCP. I hold a full DBS check and am fully insured.
I have a fee scale which is related to a client’s income to enable families from all walks of life to access the help they need and this can be sent out to you following an initial enquiry.
There is no obligation to sign up for a certain number of sessions and this can be negotiated and reviewed throughout the process of working together.
I look forward to hearing from you."

Hi, I'm Gary, and as a UKCP Accredited Integrative Psychotherapist with over 10 years experience of Counselling and Psychotherapy with Adults and Young People, my primary goal is to provide you with a space that feels safe and comfortable so that you feel able to fully and freely explore the things that may be troubling you.

Looking at it in more detail, I aim to promote healing and facilitate wholeness to ensure that all levels of a person's being and functioning (mental, physical and emotional health) are maximised to their full potential.


I do this by helping you explore the self and identify the factors in your life that are perpetuating and/or causing current concerns. The sessions are centred on the active exploration of experience – a phenomenological view of reality.


I aim to help you face each moment openly and authentically without having a pre formed attitude, opinion or expectation. This allows you to better focus on the hurts and fears that may limit your psychological freedom, and can help to recognise specific triggers that may be causing unhelpful patterns of behaviour.

Through this awareness, if you're willing, I hope to create a healthy alliance between mind and body – empowering you to start setting goals and practising new behaviours that will enable you to move beyond limitations and discover greater life satisfaction.


I see my attitude and presence in the session as crucial to creating a safe, and non-judgemental space for you to explore your life and yourself with my role as an engaging and attentive listener.


If it is useful to state it as such, my approach to therapy can be tailored to meet a variety of needs and concerns such as:


Abortion

Abuse

Addiction(s)

Affairs and betrayals

Anxiety

Bereavement

Bullying

Child related issues

Depression

Family issues

Fears

Loss

Low self-confidence

Low self-esteem

Pregnancy and birth

Redundancy

Relationship issues

Self-harm

Stress

Work-related Stress


But I do not impose labels on you, as they are not always helpful. I prefer to meet you with an open mind, and focus on the issues as you see it, using descriptions that feel most comfortable to you.


If you would like to arrange an initial session to get a better sense of what Psychotherapy with me would be like, please contact me at info@gdpsychotherapy.com or on 0203 189 1686.

If you’re feeling overwhelmed, hopeless, stuck, or like the face you present doesn’t match how you feel inside, therapy can help.

My practice is rooted in Gestalt, Person-Centred, and relational psychotherapies. The therapeutic relationship is at the heart of everything I do because it offers moments of meeting that support growth in an experiential way. I work with the connection between mind and body, and with insights from neuroscience to build up from your own resourcefulness and resilience.

I bring warmth and sensitivity, listening deeply to your struggles and supporting you to develop a compassionate curiosity towards yourself. I work with what comes up as we explore together, building awareness in the present of the patterns that might be causing pain or keeping you stuck, and so opening up spaces for new possibilities. I’m passionate about the ways the therapeutic relationship can work to support integration and fulfilment.

Professional experience
Alongside my core training (an MSc in Humanistic Psychotherapy from Metanoia Institute), I have a further postgraduate diploma in contemporary trauma practice. Prior to working in private practice, I gained experience working within various agencies including Mind and a women’s centre. My previous careers are rooted in anti-discrimination, and I have done extensive research (at doctoral level) at the intersection of gender, sexuality and power relations in mental health.

Areas I work with include: anxiety, depression, chronic shame, addictions and eating disorders, family and relationship difficulties, stress, acute and developmental trauma, abuse, discrimination and oppression, sexuality, gender dysphoria, bereavement and traumatic loss, isolation, low self-esteem, questions of identity, unexplained physical symptoms, chronic illness, life stages and transitions.

I see adults in Central London and online for short- and long-term work. I welcome you and whatever you bring to therapy. Just send me an email, text or voicenote to arrange an initial phonecall or meeting."

I offer short-term and long-term counselling and psychotherapy.

Psychotherapy is a word that derives from ancient Greek and means 'liberating the soul'. Our sessions together are an opportunity to talk about concerns and issues that might be difficult to share with family and friends and that might feel overwhelming to deal with alone.

It is a chance to feel supported, gain insight and make positive changes, in a way which respects your values, personal resources and freedom of choice.

I am passionate about facilitating transformation and healing, and providing a safe and confidential space where you can bring all of your Self, your feelings, your pain, your joy and dreams, your frustrations, your wisdom, your light and shadows.

My approach is relational, integrative and transpersonal.

Sessions mainly involve talking, but breathing exercises, mindfulness, meditation and creativity may also be useful.

If this is something that could be healing for you, please get in touch to find out more or to book an initial consultation."

Sometimes we can struggle to cope with what life throws at us. Maybe we know why, or maybe the reason is less clear or all we know is that we ‘don't feel right’. Although friends and family often want to help, sometimes it can be helpful to have someone independent to talk to, someone who won't tell us what to do and who is warm and accepting, allowing exploration of sensitive or painful issues. I believe that given the space to explore and understand our own experiencing we can all find the way forward that is right for us.

I work with individuals, offering an acceptant, warm and compassionate relationship to explore what is going on for you in your life, whether the need is targeted short-term counselling, or longer-term psychotherapy for deeper issues. I particularly work with issues around low mood and depression, anxiety, low self esteem, loss and bereavement, identity, sexuality and gender, although what’s going on for us is often complex and not so easy to categorise. I am happy to keep you ‘on track’ regarding a particular issue, or to help you explore as broadly as you wish.

I work in a person-centred/experiential way, offering the space and support for you to explore and understand your unique way of experiencing the world, and to find the way forward that is right for you. As we work together you may find that you develop improved self-awareness and self-compassion and feel better equipped to handle future issues.

The quality of the relationship between client and counsellor is key, so I suggest a phone call to arrange an initial session during which we can explore what has brought you to counselling and see how we get on together.

I offer sessions from premises in the S11 area of Sheffield, with access up one flight of stairs. The premises are private and safe with plenty of on-street parking. The 88/83 (not 83a) buses serve the area.

I work midweek (Tue and Wed) afternoons and early evenings up to 6pm. I charge £60 for 60 minutes, usually payable by bank transfer."

In psychotherapy and counselling we are concerned with your emotional wellbeing. Through talking with a psychotherapist, you gain a deeper understanding of yourself, your patterns, and how you relate to others. This opens up the possibility of new avenues and new ways of being with others, as well as feeling more at ease within oneself.

By coming to psychotherapy you are taking the first step towards change

As a psychotherapist my aim is to create a confidential, sensitive, and supportive environment where you feel able to explore your feelings, thoughts and behaviours. We look at what is happening in your life at present as well as your past, to understand how your life experiences have contributed to the person you are today and to the circumstances that you find yourself in.

I have worked with many clients presenting with a wide range of issues such as anxiety, panic attacks, depression, relationship issues, processing past events and trauma, loss and grief, dealing with illnesses or with major life changes. Sometimes circumstances and feelings can be so overwhelming that people feel stuck, confused, and torn. In therapy we can gain more clarity about where we are at, who we are, and different ways forward.

How does it work?

I work with clients weekly during a regular, mutually agreed, slot. The duration of therapy can be either open-ended or for an agreed time period of six sessions or more, depending on the issues presented. My fee is £50 pounds per session.

About me

I have a diploma in Transactional Analysis Psychotherapy as well as a diploma in Transactional Analysis psychotherapeutic counselling. I am a Certified Transactional Analyst (CTA), UKCP registered and a registered member of the BACP (British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy).

Transactional Analysis as a therapy approach

Transactional Analysis (TA) began in the 1950ies when Eric Berne developed this new therapy approach. TA was initially a group therapy, part of which was the observation and challenging of patterns of communicating between the members of the group. A ‘unit of communication’, i.e. something communicated to a person and their response back was called a ‘transaction’, hence the name ‘Transactional Analysis’. Over the decades TA has developed to become an effective theoretical framework for the work with individuals and couples. It incorporates many key themes of from humanistic, integrative, psychoanalytical, and psychodynamic therapies.

The philosophical assumptions of TA are that people can think and decide their own destiny, that they can change and that everyone is equal. It assumes that people decide early on in life on an unconscious life plan, a ‘script’, which they will reinforce unconsciously over the years through ‘outdated’ or hindering patterns of behaving, thinking, feeling and relating to others. The idea of therapy is that through the dialogue with the therapist, and by paying attention to the relationship between therapist and client, where such patterns are likely to manifest, this can be brought into consciousness and challenged. Thus the possibility of a new ‘script’, a different way forward, and a new way of being emerges.

I have considerable experience of working with people who have suffered trauma, both single episodes of major trauma and more persistent ongoing trauma such as may occur in childhood including sexual abuse. Sometimes parents have not been deliberately cruel but have been unable to meet their child's needs and low self-esteem can be the result affecting many areas of a person's life.

My previous career was that of a GP and I am experienced in working with those who have been diagnosed with chronic or life-threatening diseases and/or their carers.

I have experience of working with people with a range of emotional issues .I am happy to have a brief conversation over the phone if this is something you would like in the first instance. Feel free to contact me to see if I can help you.

The first session will be an introductory session where we can explore whether you wish to attend for short term therapy or open ended sessions. It is important for both of us that we feel comfortable working with each other. Sessions can be ended when you would like to and there is no obligation to stay for a set number of sessions.

I provide therapy to clients usually on a weekly basis (the same time on the same day each week) and I also offer therapy to clients who require flexibility within the weekly sessions and timings."

I'm an approachable and non-judgemental integrative counsellor and my private practice is devoted to creating a confidential and supportive environment for you to explore and work through issues that you are experiencing. I am based in central Norwich, very close to Tombland, and also work in East Green near Saxmundham on Fridays.

Before training as a counsellor, I worked within HR in the corporate world. I found what I enjoyed most was working with people at depth, and outside the bounds of rigid policies or institutional expectations. This is why I chose to train in the world of psychotherapy and counselling.

Finding the right counsellor to talk with is very important and can feel like a challenge in itself. I find the most reliable predictor of whether any therapy will be useful for someone is whether they feel an alliance with the counsellor they are working with. Attention to our inner lives requires respect and courage yet fosters greater understanding, healing, growth, and the making of a happier life. You can speak to me in confidence, I will be open, honest, and committed to our work.

I am committed to ensuring my practice is an inclusive and respectful space for all; regardless of sexuality, gender identity, race, religion, age, body size, or ability.

I am a fully accredited member of the UKCP (UK Council for Psychotherapy) and as well as my private counselling practice I have worked for the University of East Anglia's wellbeing service providing counselling to students and staff between 2015 and 2020.

I have experience working with trainee counsellors and welcome interest from all scenarios including those beginning their studies or looking to switch to an integrative counsellor for course requirements.  I do tend to only work with one client from each training group. 

I have experience with but not limited to: relationship problems, suicide, sexuality, infidelity, anxiety, depression, sexual issues, self-esteem, loneliness, addiction, gender identity, loss, bereavement, bullying, work difficulties, and family issues."

But what if the therapeutic journey also allowed life to reveal itself to you in exciting, satisfying, challenging and sometimes scary ways? One could perhaps re-imagine it as a mythical struggle born of the desire to be free from pain but ultimately pointing to a deeper understanding of what it is to be alive.
Therapy is a relationship, I believe that the therapeutic relationship itself is responsible for much of the healing that takes place, the deeper the sense of trust the greater the chance of change. For me it is a privilege to witness someone like you as you start to trust that you can allow who you fully are to emerge and having someone to accompany you on that journey makes all the difference.

For 12 years, starting in the late 90’s I helped create a charity that pioneered outdoor camping retreats, an experience that shaped and inspired my Buddhist influences. Later I felt drawn back to to the Psychological and the Soulful and a powerful Transpersonal Training at Re-Vision in London. I enjoy living in rural Devon where my interests include Tai Chi, Improvised acting, Dancing and still think I can play a bit of football!. My counselling practice is grounded in over 30 years of personal growth work and inspired by the Human capacity to be ever more present with life’s rich experience.

I am a senior psychotherapist with extensive experience, working with people of all ages and backgrounds, to find ways of dealing with life’s difficulties and challenges in a therapeutic setting. I provide a safe space to explore difficult emotional territory and together discover ways of tackling the issues that arise.

My training has included hypno-psychotherapy, psychoanalytic psychotherapy, Neuro-linguistic Programming, Gestalt and Group Analytic Work. All these disciplines allow for a range of approaches which best suits the issues being discussed. In this way, I can offer a client led practice tailored to specific individual needs.

Approaching therapy for the first time, or even coming back after an absence, can be daunting and in itself cause anxiety. My starting point is always to recognise the person and understand the reasons why therapy is being sought. With over twelve years of clinical experience in a diverse number of settings I have worked with many, many clients creating conditions which enable people to feel safe discussing distressing or even taboo thoughts and feelings.

I specialize in treating abuse, addiction, anger, anxiety, loss, bereavement, depression, relationships, sexuality, gender issues, LGBT+, shame, and trauma. I divide my time between working in the NHS, for charity organisation run therapy centres, and in private practice.

I work in English and Arabic."

Therapy can provide a space for you to explore whatever it is that has led you to look for a therapist. I know how daunting it can be to choose a therapist but I also know that despite the range of challenges that you may encounter in therapy it is possible to emerge feeling better equipped to deal with the realities of life. I think of psychotherapy as a process that should lead to lasting benefits in everyday life and relationships beyond the therapy room. This can be achieved in many different ways. However, in my experience it does always involve compassion and support from the therapist towards the client.

A useful starting point for any potential work together might be an exploration of your motivation to seek therapy at this time in your life and what it is you are looking for help with and/or what it is you may wish to make sense of. Together we can explore whether I am able to provide you with what you and the situation requires. In other words: Are we a good match?

If you are drawn to my profile below please feel free to contact me with the option to arrange an initial no-obligation session free of charge. This will allow you to meet me face to face and to get a feel for how we might work together. 

How I work as a therapist:

I view the uniqueness of each relationship as a potential force for healing and growth; hence I place the quality of the relationship at the heart of what I do. Therapy for me is something that we create together making my style as a therapist a collaborative one. I enjoy the unique quality of each relationship and therefore the therapy I offer is highly individualised with its own pace and characteristics. I work from the assumption that all people are lifelong learners and teachers and make no exception for the client therapist relationship.

I understand how difficult it can be to risk revealing your innermost thoughts and feelings to another person. And there may be times when there are no words; perhaps a feeling of emptiness and/or a sense that “not all is well” without knowing what it is all about. As a therapist I might feel the intensity of thoughts, and/or emotions with you, appreciating how life is for you. This is when I have witnessed change on many levels. It can open up the possibilities to experience the choices that are available to us more fully.

How I have been trained:

As an Integrative psychotherapist I have studied a variety of theories that fit a ""humanistic relational developmental approach"". This means that particular attention is paid to relationships, past and present. Early life experiences which may link with current distress and behaviour are viewed as potential sources of information that can help us to understand the relationships that shape our current lives. You might choose to look at events in your past so that together we can consider what relevance they may have to your current situation.

Particular interests and experiences I bring as a therapist:

My background includes working in the voluntary sector with people with learning difficulties going back more than 35 years. I actively welcome this client group to access counselling and psychotherapy.
I have significant experience in working with people who have experienced sexual assault/abuse and rape, including working as a therapist in this field.

I have engaged in depth with organisational change and in the issues carers and professionals have to face in adult social care (mostly around adults with learning difficulties). I have played an active role in creating safe environments that offer opportunities for people to live the fullest lives possible.

My work in adult social care combined with my lifelong interest in difference, diversity, exclusion, inequality and the mechanisms that feed oppression has led me to psychotherapy, as a client and eventually as a therapist.

This is not always easy. Therapy can require us to be courageous in the face of long-held difficulties and attitudes and for us to experiment with new ways of being. It can involve us facing meeting our shame or anxiety when we have spent a long time trying to run away from them. It is a thoughtful endeavour. I aim to provide support to enable you to do this and also to be able to find self-compassion and humour.

I have experience of working with a broad range of people; who have brought their feelings and thoughts around loneliness, relationship difficulties, anxiety, fear, personal identity and trauma.

I completed my first course in Gestalt in 1990 -1994 with Gestalt Training Services. I completed a further year in 2003 with Edinburgh Gestalt Institute. I have experience in working in counselling services in higher education and voluntary organisations, as well as having been a social worker for many years in local authority adult services.

I have a particular interest in working with shame and how it is managed in a relationship. I also have an interest in how our story is held in our body, how we hold ourselves and how we use our breath to support ourselves in relationship. I find that working with body process can be enlivening and allow us to discover or rediscover aspects of ourselves we were not.

I am currently only offering online therapy."

I provide a supportive and private place for you to explore the challenges you are facing, and I work with clients in a broad range of issues; from people in a life crisis who need to talk to someone, to people who want to spend time exploring and discovering more of who they are, or wanting to make lasting changes in areas of life they feel stuck in.

My approach involves supporting you to explore areas of interest to you, and to increase your self-awareness through non-judgemental acceptance. I firmly believe our personality now was a positive response to the environment we faced when the original adjustment was made, and through understanding this you can begin to reclaim parts of you that are important but might have been forgotten. My Gestalt approach can also involve helping you to use your body as a way to access hidden emotions.

I am well supported in individual and group supervision and abide by the UKCP ethical framework and code of practice, and my personal interest in mindfulness and meditation can inform our work.

We can talk about me, and what clients say about me later. But for now, let's establish how you can benefit from professional support......

Does any of this sound like you?

""I want to reduce stress""
""I feel anxious all the time""
""I wish my life wasn't ruled by panic attacks""
""I want to feel optimistic instead of negative all the time""

...Or perhaps you want some direction in life, become more productive or improve your relationships.

Whether it’s anger, bereavement, bullying, life having no purpose, low-self esteem, the menopause, personal development, redundancy or retirement. Counselling can help.

So why not have a browse through my profile and website to see if I can help?"

“Before every session, I take a moment to remember my humanity. There is no experience that this man has that I cannot share with him, no fear that I cannot understand, no suffering that I cannot care about, because I too am human.
No matter how deep his wound, he does not need to be ashamed in front of me. I too am vulnerable. And because of this, I am enough. Whatever his story, he no longer needs to be alone with it. This is what will allow his healing to begin.”

I aim to help anyone coming to therapy feel comfortable discussing the issues or difficulties they might struggle with.

I am mindful that people have stories that are painful to share, and therefore my initial approach is to create a safe space where everyone feels heard and listened to. I also understand that the relationship with the therapist is essential and a matter of human connection. Therefore, my initial one-hour session is always free and will help us better understand how I work, and we can decide together whether you wish to invest in future sessions.

I have experience working with couples and families and with neurodiversity such as ADHD or ASC (or autism). My approach is holistic, looking at the individual, the family's relationships, patterns from previous generations, and unresolved traumas. It also looks at the society where people live or how they see each other through the eyes of culture.

I am Maria. I am a qualified Psychotherapist and Clinical Supervisor and I provide therapeutic support to children, adolescents and adults. I am also a certified Cyber Therapist.

I currently work exclusively online.

My approach is Integrative. This means that I am trained in several psychotherapeutic approaches, which enables me to create a therapy based on each individual's needs. I am also trained in the Therapeutic use of the Arts.

My private practice is in Muswell Hill, N10. To book an initial consultation, you can contact me at mariadokanari@yahoo.com or on 07956699601. I can offer sessions in English or Greek language.

Psychotherapy:

I practice empathic, trauma-informed and attachment-informed psychotherapy.
I work on a one-to-one basis to help children or adults who experience emotional difficulties or go through a life crisis, as well as with both, parent and child in joint sessions, to help strengthen their relationship. I also offer support and consultancy to parents.

My work takes place in the context of an empathic therapeutic relationship. In a safe, caring and confidential space, I help children and adults work through psychological pain and trauma and improve their relationship with themselves and others, as well as cope with every day stressors and live more fulfilling lives.

Part of the work can be using image, metaphor, play and the Arts (clay, paint, music, puppetry, poetry, drama, sandplay, dance and movement), that can encourage self-awareness, enable creativity and offer individuals a language to talk about their feelings in a safe and non-threatening way.

With children in particular, the Arts can be a powerful way of sensory or non-verbal communication, which, through a trusting relationship, can be an emotionally regulating and therapeutic experience.

I have an interest in supporting children and families around neurodiversity and disability and in working alongside them to help them live their lives confidently.

I have experience in working with children, adolescents, adults and families with a range of difficulties around: trauma, bereavement, anxiety, social anxiety, negative body image, low self-esteem, depression, self-harming, aggression, withdrawal, bullying, abuse, sexual abuse, domestic violence, divorce, illness, substance and alcohol abuse, difficulties in social skills and peer relationships, attachment and relational difficulties, gender and sexuality related difficulties, difficulties related to social rejection.

Past experience:
Past experience includes working at CAMHS, NHS (National Health Service - Schools and Triage), where I supported therapeutically clients who struggled with complex issues, and within education (nurseries, primary and secondary schools), where I provided therapy to students and supervision to school staff.

I have trained in child & adolescent psychotherapy, parent-child work, psychology, art psychotherapy, counselling, relational psychotherapy. I have also undergone official training and have qualified as a clinical supervisor.

I work sensitively and support clients around difference (e.g. LGBTQI+, gender, sexuality, race, culture, disability, neurodiversity).

My practice is LGBTQI+ affirmative.

My practice is Neurodiversity and disability affirmative.

I work in an inclusive and ethically responsible way, which is not neutral to social injustice and discrimination, to the violation of human rights and to the oppressions faced by marginalised groups.

Supervision:
I offer supervision, support and guidance to adult and child Counsellor and Psychotherapists, coaches, practitioners of helping professions and practitioners who work in health and education. I also offer reflective practice and consultancy to all professionals (non-clinical) who want to benefit from a supportive space in which they can reflect on their work and gain insight into their personal and professional development.

I offer one to one or group supervision.

I have regular clinical supervision and I abide by the code of Ethics of the United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP) and the Institute for Arts in Therapy and Education (IATE).

Initial consultation
To book an initial consultation, please contact me on the provided contact details. In the first meeting, we will explore your concerns (or your concerns regarding your child), I will answer any questions you may have and we will decide together if therapy is suitable for you (or your child). The initial consultation (and subsequent parent meetings) are charged at the standard session rate (session rate: £75-£85).

The duration of therapy depends on the individual circumstances and we regularly review the work together.
Sessions last 50 minutes and take place on a weekly basis, on the same day and at the same time.

All sessions are confidential."

Sometimes they are overwhelming in their intensity or sometimes we just feel stuck, as if things will never change.

Psychotherapy offers a way to think about what is happening in the present, reflect on patterns and links from the past and explore how change can happen.

I have worked for many years with adults of all ages and backgrounds and with a wide range of concerns and problems. I offer a safe place where you will be heard and where we can think together.

Starting therapy can feel a big step and finding the right therapist for you is always important. I offer an initial session, or more, so we can talk about your difficulties and start to get to know each other.

My approach is collaborative and client-centred. One of my primary goals is to work with you to achieve an understanding of the subtle, and complicated, ways people see and experience the world. Psychotherapy offers a route towards enhancing an awareness of personal experience and the meanings generated from it, and creates the potential for exercising choice in how you approach others. I meet each client with openness, flexibility and respect.

My psychotherapy practice offers you a secure space to explore urgent or long-term problems you may be experiencing - a place to find yourself in the world. While my therapeutic approach is primarily located within a psychoanalytical framework, I have developed mindfulness therapies alongside this, which can offer an integrative and client-centred pathway. I can combine traditional psychotherapy with mindfulness, or create different pathways through each depending on who you are and what you need.

I am interested in supporting you to develop an awareness of how the past may be impacting on your life, build awareness and insight, and support your ability to choose different ways of being in the world and relating to self and other.

I offer short or long-term psychotherapy and mindfulness teaching. We can discuss in our sessions what may be most suitable, and be flexible about how needs can change over time.

I also offer supervision as part of my private practice.

My therapy rooms are located in Liverpool Street, EC2M. Please look at my website for further information http://eastlondonpsychotherapy.co.uk."

Perhaps you are struggling with anxiety or depression, or feeling stuck or overwhelmed in some way. At such times, therapy can help us navigate through and beyond.

I offer a supportive, confidential environment to explore whatever your concerns are. It is a safe space in which anything can be said without judgement. I do not seek to categorise or diagnose you. Indeed, I do not see you as broken, or in need of a cure as such. I see my role as helping you to make sense of your struggle so that you can move forward and embrace life more fully.

My way of working is gentle but challenging. Therapy is a collaborative journey and I believe that the most important element is a deeply caring, trusting relationship. I will listen and respond with care and compassion while supporting you to deepen your understanding of yourself and the issues you are facing.

And therapy is not just about alleviating suffering, confusion or pain. The challenges we face, however difficult, can also be tremendous opportunities for growth. Working through your struggles can be the start of a new beginning.

I provide an initial session free of charge, which will give us an opportunity to discuss your needs and expectations, and allow us to decide whether to enter into therapy together. If you would like to enquire about an initial session, or if you have any questions, please feel free to get in touch.


About me:

I have wide-ranging experience working with all sorts of issues, with adults of all ages and backgrounds. My initial training was in integrative psychotherapy, and I adapt my approach to the needs of my clients. I have also undertaken advanced training in existential psychotherapy.

In addition to my private practice, I am a visiting lecturer in psychotherapy at Regent's University London.

I also worked for several years at a charity providing low-cost, long-term therapy to the unemployed and those on low-incomes, and spent several years within an NHS IAPT counselling service.

I am a private and NHS psychotherapist. I have an integrative and psychodynamic training and am experienced in working with a range of difficulties including complex depression and anxiety, self-esteem issues, relationship problems and personality disorders. I have provided assessments and psychological interventions within a range of NHS settings since 2011 including a secondary care complex depression and anxiety setting and a specialist personality disorder service (South West London and St George’s Mental Health NHS Trust South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust). My work often focuses on helping people who find themselves stuck in unhelpful patterns of behaviour and who are struggling with relational issues. I am qualified in utilising evidence based interventions such as Dynamic Interpersonal Therapy (DIT) and Mentalization Based Therapy (MBT) to help people whose interpersonal difficulties (both in their private and work life) contribute to symptoms of depression and anxiety. Therapy can help to reduce emotional suffering, support change, and promote personal growth. It is a collaborative process and the insight gained can help people look at life from a different perspective and enable them to respond differently to life’s challenges. People often seek support when they are facing life transitions or feel stuck in their lives. However there are many reasons why people might seek the help of therapy. These might include:
 Relationship difficulties or break ups
 Problems in the workplace
 Loss and bereavement
 Self-esteem issues
 Difficulties relating to childhood
 Trauma
 Depression
 Anxiety and stress
 Personality disorder

See more at https://www.rossandersontherapy.com/

I provide individual and relationship therapy.

I don’t believe therapy should be mysterious or intimidating. My style of therapy is warm, honest and human; I like to be transparent about the process and I invite you to comment and ask questions about the way we are working.

Together we will embark upon a process of radical reflection - this will enable you to see more clearly the parts of your life which are blocking you from reaching your full potential. Although the content of what we talk about may sometimes be painful, therapy can also at times be playful, creative and joyful.

Maybe you’re having difficulties in relationships or struggling with intense emotions; perhaps you’re recovering from childhood trauma or you’re searching for more meaning in your life. Therapy can help you to address these challenging aspects while moving closer towards specific goals. It is my role to guide you along this journey in a manner that is collaborative and respectful.

If you're feeling stuck or confused, therapy can provide a new perspective and unlock healthier ways to live.

I work from my home in Worthing BN11. You may meet my friendly whippet, Blitzen, but if you have allergies I can keep her in another room. I also work from the Brighton Therapy Centre, BN1.

Do your relationships leave you feeling unfulfilled and lonely? Are you troubled by traumatic memories? Wondering where to turn? Reach out for help.

I am a fully qualified, UKCP Registered Psychotherapeutic Counsellor offering confidential long term in-depth psychotherapeutic counselling and short term brief and focal counselling in the heart of Newcastle. I integrate mindfulness practices into this work to support you to ground yourself through difficult experiences. My approach is warm, relaxed and compassionate. In counselling you will have the undivided attention of a trained person outside your situation – a fresh pair of eyes and ears – to help you explore what has brought you here and find some perspective.

Perhaps you have never felt like you fit anywhere. Perhaps you were abused, neglected or bullied in childhood and wonder who you might be if only you had the chance to meet your potential. Perhaps a sudden trauma, relationship betrayal or bereavement has derailed you and made you question your whole life. As a relationally trained therapist, I am skilled in helping people to improve their self-esteem, to have more satisfying relationships with themselves and others and to find meaning in their lives.


My Approach:

My training is Integrative, using aspects of humanistic-existential approaches such as Person Centred therapy, Gestalt and Transactional Analysis, and informed by Psychodynamics, developmental psychology and attachment theory. This means that I can draw on different therapeutic models to fit your needs. My training is also Relational, meaning that we will make use of the therapeutic relationship, noticing what happens between us so that you can better understand your way of being with others and find new ways to connect. I see counselling as a co-creation and collaboration involving us both. Research has shown that establishing healthy relationships is critical to our emotional wellbeing. It is also true to say that much of the harm that is done to us or the stress that we encounter in life happens in the context of our relationships with others. With its strong focus on the relationship between counsellor and client, relational therapy can help in healing your relational wounds.

I enjoy offering creative and symbolic ways of working, such as through story, play, chair work, drawing and working with clay.


Long-term Psychotherapeutic Counselling:

This is usually open-ended. I can support you to look deeply at your thoughts, emotions, behaviour and ingrained patterns of relating, which often have their roots in childhood, so that you can develop a greater understanding and awareness of yourself and make changes. Our work will be anchored in the present but we will attend to how past memories and future concerns impact you in the here and now. Long-term work has the potential to lead to profound growth and personality restructuring over time.


Short-term Brief and Focal Counselling:

In brief and focal work we may agree on 6-12 sessions then reassess. I support you to focus on one, or a few specific issues and work towards defined goals. Although it may be helpful for me to offer guidance, structure and techniques at times, most of the transformation and insights you experience will simply emerge out of the deep attention we give your concerns.


Inner Child Work:

I am skilled in inner child work. As a sensitive, nurturing and sometimes playful practitioner, I can support you to connect with and attend to younger wounded or traumatised parts of yourself. I facilitate this work through a range of media such as grounding exercises, mindful enquiry, drawing, play and stories. This work can be particularly helpful if you have attachment issues and where there is trauma, loss or painful transitions in childhood.

Our inner children, with their inexperience and early developmental level, their sometimes deep wounding and trauma, their strong feelings of anxiety, rage, grief and loss, are not equipped to deal with the stuff of adult life. Yet how often do we leave it to them to run our lives? In my experience, when we care for our inner children and lift the burden of adult life from their shoulders, our lives become less stressful. We find ourselves free to respond to life more cleanly from the present.


Mindfulness:

I integrate mindfulness into all forms of counselling where it seems useful. Mindfulness is a process of anchoring yourself in the present moment by turning an accepting awareness to your thoughts, feelings and perceptions, often through meditation. Mindfulness is particularly effective for anxiety and panic disorders. It can also help to reduce stress and increase your ability to safely manage the powerful emotions triggered during trauma work. Over time, mindfulness supports you to build a kindly and patient attitude towards yourself which can be particularly helpful if you tend to be very self-critical.


Getting started:

Taking that first step can often feel difficult especially if we don't know what to expect.

All you need do right at the start is get in touch! I am happy for you to contact me in whatever way feels most comfortable - by telephone call, text or email and we can arrange an initial meeting/assessment.

I offer an optional, free 15 minute pre-assessment telephone consultation. This is an opportunity for you to connect with me before meeting and ask questions, which can be helpful if you are nervous or a bit unsure.

All sessions are 60 minutes long. Our assessment session is a chance for us to get to know each other a little - you will have the space to tell me what you has brought you to counselling, and I can explain how I work and answer any questions you have. After that, I can tell you if I think I can help you and you can decide if it feels a good fit for you. Some people know right away, others like to go away and have a think about it.

If we decide to continue, we will then agree a day and time to meet, usually weekly. You might already have an idea as to whether you want to work long or short term, or you may wish to contract for 6-12 sessions and see how you feel as we work together.

I work from my own private, quiet counselling room on the first floor of MEA House. There is full disabled access, including lift and accessible toilets. The building has reception cover, waiting area and a café on the ground floor.


Training, qualifications and experience:

- Level 7 Advanced Diploma in Relationally-centred Psychotherapeutic Counselling

- BSc Hons in Social Work/Disability Studies.

My professional background for the past 20 years has been in mental health, learning disabilities, advocacy and welfare rights settings.

I have previously volunteered as a counsellor in two North East charities. My work is now primarily in private practice and I also do some counselling work for a mental health charity. I have worked with people with a range of issues including depression, anxiety and stress; relationship issues; loneliness; trauma stemming from childhood experiences of emotional, physical and sexual abuse and neglect; dissociation; struggles in the workplace; bullying; domestic abuse; bereavement; low self-confidence; caring responsibilities and many more.

I have also had a Buddhist Insight meditation practice for 20 years and regularly attend meditation retreats."

Painful emotions can affect all of us at some time or another, perhaps triggered by life events that have left us feeling disempowered, low on resources and pessimistic about the future. If any of this strikes a chord then perhaps it is time for you to put your wellbeing first and consider talking to someone that is professionally trained to listen and help you navigate a way through the confusion.
I decided to retrain as a psychotherapist after spending many years editing magazines for major brands such as IKEA. It was my own personal experience of going to therapy and the positive impact it had on my life, especially in terms of having a better understanding of myself and improving the quality of my relationships with others, that influenced my decision to change career.
I now have many years experience as a psychotherapist and have worked within the charity sector, the NHS and in private practice.
Deciding to see a therapist can seem like a big step and you may have heard all sorts of things about what therapy is or isn’t. For me looking after our mental health is as important as taking care of our physical self and I believe that above all therapy is about the creation of a space, where you are free to talk about whatever it is that is causing you distress or confusion and to discover more about yourself and your relational patterns. Freud described it as making the unconscious, conscious, so we are more liberated to get on with our lives. I believe that it is the relationship between therapist and client that is central to bringing about these changes. Whatever it is that brings you to therapy I can assure you of a supportive, non- judgemental approach and that I will make the best-possible use of all of my training and experience in our work together. It’s qute unsual to be uncertain about making the first move to see a therapist and arranging an initial meeting is always a good way to further explore what you are hoping to gain from counselling or therapy ."

That’s when psychotherapy can help. I offer a safe, confidential and non-judgemental space to talk. I believe in the value of feeling heard and understood, and that talking to a trained therapist can make a genuine difference to a person’s life.

If you are new to therapy, you may ask how it is different to talking to a friend. My answer is that the process is not the same. I am here to listen, and I mean really listen to what you are going through, without any preconceived ideas about who you are or what you have experienced in life. Together we will reflect on what is troubling you: perhaps loneliness, anxiety, loss, relationships difficulties, a trauma that won’t go away or a sense of feeling low and unsatisfied with life. In this process of talking, you will come to understand yourself better – and once you do, things can shift, past experiences can be processed, narratives reframed, and change can happen.

My commitment is to bring my professional experience to these conversations. I am an Integrative Psychotherapist, meaning I draw on my broad knowledge base of different schools of psychotherapeutic thought to offer a flexible and creative approach tailored to your needs. With further advanced training in Existential Psychotherapy, I will also attend to the challenges, limitations and possibilities of life as you experience it. Together we will explore how to find meaning in your life.

Currently, I am dedicated to my private practice. I have previously worked at a busy NHS GP practice, Croydon University Hospital, a large hospice and a private practice in Mayfair. I have also taught on the Advanced Diploma in Existential Psychotherapy at Regent’s University, and provided supervision to MA psychotherapy students there. My own academic background is in Social Anthropology, and I believe that my long-standing interest in people’s social and cultural beliefs strengthens my psychotherapy practice.

I am a warm, compassionate and thoughtful therapist. My style is conversational and I welcome feedback from clients about how they experience our work together. I regularly review sessions to encourage a collaborative process.

I offer an initial free no commitment telephone consultation to anyone interested in working with me."

I understand that you may want to know a little more about me before deciding to work together:

Despair and suffering are the catalysts that usually bring someone to therapy and this can be the beginning of a transformational and alchemical journey with creative process and compassion at the heart of the work.

I began my career working in the film industry. However, an interest in holistic and complementary therapies led me to a different path and I became a qualified Aromatherapist. I specialised in working in the field of HIV/AIDS and worked with several organisations including London Lighthouse, Immune Development Trust and across several NHS treatment schemes. I was one of the core Aromatherapy tutors for the professional training at the Tisserand Institute and also taught their subtle energy module for several years.

My own suffering deepened my path and I developed an interest in mindfulness meditation. Training as a Core Process Psychotherapist was a natural progression and I qualified as a UKCP registered psychotherapist in 2003 and have been in private practice since then.

For the last 17 years I have provided psychological consulting to organisations, written articles and taught on aspects of trauma, resilience and wellbeing. Organisations worked with include: Pret a Manger, London Fire Brigade, and St Mungo’s. I have recently joined the teaching faculty of the Karuna Institute on their four year MA in Mindfulness-based Core Process Psychotherapy.

As a psycho-spiritual psychotherapist I am interested in the subtle embodiment of the deep imagination and the healing potential of working with nature and the land. I have also begun to integrate the worlds of aromatherapy and psychotherapy. I currently offer Psychotherapy, Supervision and Psycho-aromatherapy from Bath and Bristol.

My path is influenced by interests in Celtic mythology &amp; spirituality, interpersonal creativity, wellbeing, resilience, eco-psychology, sacred plant medicine and a heart-mind-body practice which informs all aspects of my work."

I think that you are here because you are thinking about or have decided that you are ready to have therapy because you are or have been experiencing emotional difficulties and distress. Perhaps you’re looking for a therapist for a friend or family member.
No matter the reason welcome. Coming for therapy is often a new experience and can feel frightening. However, it is the beginning of a journey of self-healing whilst being supported by a trained professional. Psychotherapy is a concentrated time to focus on yourself. A chance to explore aspects of your life and relationships, a safe space to look at yourself and deal with challenges in life with emotional support. Sometimes it is difficult to know why we are feeling unhappy, and it takes courage to make that first move, to step out of our comfort zone and look for support from somebody outside your circle of friends and family.
I am a UKCP and AFT registered psychotherapist with 30 years’ experience in mental health working with children, young people, adults, couples, and families from diverse racial and cultural backgrounds. I am also a registered member of the Black African and Asian Therapy Network [BAATN]. I completed my training in Systemic Psychotherapy at the Tavistock & Portman Centre in London. I have also achieved an MA in Child Forensic Studies Psychology & Law, a BSc (Hons) in Social Science and a Diploma in Social Work.
I chose to become a Systemic Psychotherapist as it is fundamentally different from other therapies. The work invites people to mobilise the strengths of their relationships to make challenging situations less problematic. It also focuses on the interactions and relationships between members of the family to help them address any problems and to move on.
I have a particular interest in relieving the combined effects on mind and body of unresolved trauma as I understand that upsetting events, relationships or painful emotions may block self-belief in our ability to heal ourselves. My other interests are attachment issues, sexual trauma, unresolved trauma, domestic abuse and eating disorders. I have worked with a wide range of issues including anxiety, depression, addiction, loss and separation, domestic abuse and toxic relationships, personality disorders, PTSD/CPTSD, Bipolar Disorder, ADHD, low self-esteem, low self-worth, survivors of cyber and direct bullying, bereavement, child abuse, adult and adolescent living with all types of eating disorders especially anorexia nervosa in which I am trained in the Maudsley Model of Anorexia Nervosa Treatment for Adults (MANTRA).
I am currently working part time with trauma and eating disorder in a prestigious CAMHS T4 hospital. My work is with high-risk patients on a general adolescent ward and with patients on an eating disorder ward. Most of the patients that I work with are on s2 or s3 of the Mental Health Act 1983. I also work part time in my own private practise in which you can contact me at time2healpsychothepy@outlook.com
I am known for my warmth and aim to create a space where my clients feel valued, particularly the parts of them that have felt undervalued, ashamed, worthless, and guilty. Through this healing space, it has allowed my clients to voice what was previously unsaid so that they can tell a new more hopeful story."

Sometimes, when you are hurt, you may need the help of a walking stick until you can walk on our own again. Psychotherapy is there to support you and offer something for you to lean on until you feel able to to deal with things by yourself again.

Research shows a direct relationship between emotions such as sadness and stress, and pain levels. By better understanding these emotions and how your body responds to them, psychotherapy can help you to deal with them differently.

Each individual is unique. You all have different emotions and ways of thinking; you feel, manage and react to them in different ways.

From time to time, everyone feels stuck with uncomfortable or unwanted emotions and thoughts that cause us distress and discomfort.

When left unmanaged, these thoughts can lead to depression, anxiety, panic attacks and anger problems that may also affect those around us.

Psychotherapy creates a space where you lean new tools to manage your uncomfortable thoughts or behaviours, experiment with new ways of thinking and acting, or just a space to offload things that are too heavy to hold onto by yourself. I will support you by working with your emotions and thoughts to help you better understand your frustrations and difficulties as well as your strengths and abilities."

My interests developed into the works of existential thinkers Friedrich Nietzsche and Jean Paul Sartre.The Existential approach is a philosophical method of therapy that operates on the belief that inner conflict within a person is due to that individual's confrontation with the givens of existence. At the time, I had a great need to understand my own existence and how my values gave meaning to my life.

My interests also grew into psychoanalytic theories that suggests a person's development is determined by events in early childhood. This led to an even greater interest into the work of John Bowlby, notable for his interest in child development and for his pioneering work in attachment theory. I became curious about Gestalt therapy whose primary aim is &lsquo;awareness.&rsquo; I found the directness of Gestalt therapy made it easier for me to support clients in acknowledging issues in the early stages of therapy.

My training as a Psychotherapist began in 2000 and I achieved a Masters Degree in Existential Psychotherapy & Counselling in 2004. Since then, I have completed post graduate studies in Couples Counselling, Group Therapy, Relationship Therapy and a postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Supervision. I am currently undertaking training in Trauma Therapy.

I have many years of experience working with a wide range of psychological, emotional and mental health problems and specialise in working with depression, anxiety and Couples. I am also a certified Coach and have extensive experience working in corporate environments and I am fluent in Spanish and Turkish.I was born in London, but moved to Orange County, California, where I finished high school and completed my first degree in Latin American Studies. My interests in languages inspired me to learn Spanish and later went onto to learn Turkish too. This eventually led to me accompanying Sultan Kosen, the Tallest Man in the World, to over 15 countries as his Relationship Manager. I was also featured in the Discovery documentary, &lsquo;The Tallest man in the world, looking for love&rsquo; that aired on Channel 4 in 2011. My earlier career included extensive work in the media industry as a Human Resources specialist."

Often our early experiences in our families don't equip us to manage life as well as we would like. This can cause difficulties in our relationships, both with ourselves and others and can lead us to repeat patterns that are unhelpful and leave us feeling depressed and anxious or stuck and unfulfilled.

Therapy can help us to understand ourselves, to reflect on and make sense of our experiences and to give us the resources to cope with difficult feelings and circumstances. It can help us to improve our relationships and make better decisions. It can also help to build resilience and self-esteem so that we can function better in our work and personal lives.

I have experience working with individuals for the short, medium and long-term.

Testimonial: Gemma: “I have been having therapy with Pippa Fairhead for the last year. She brings a wealth of insight and experience which has been and continues to be immensely helpful. In therapy, it’s the careful unpicking of life experiences and the attention to detail which are crucial to understanding the past in terms of the present. Pippa has illuminated so many apparently small things which all add up to why I behave and feel the way I do. Added to this, she has a very warm and welcoming presence which makes it easy to engage with her.”

It’s OK if you’re not even sure what words truly describe your experience, my role as a therapist is to guide you away from struggling and towards flourishing. Most often, my work is grounded in the present, focussed on solutions, and oriented towards the future, however that’s not to say the past should be ignored, it may need to be honoured, processed and integrated into the present before moving forwards.

I have experience in helping people with a wide range of issues, which often involve emotional struggles or behavioural problems. These come with many different labels such as anxiety, depression, addiction, self-criticism, shame, trauma, phobias, relationship problems, and so on. Whilst such labels can be helpful, and demonstrate that such experiences are far from unique, they often paint an incomplete picture; my work is not about the labels, but the experience itself.

Therapy sessions at my private practice in London Bridge have been suspended since the Covid19 pandemic, so I am currently only offering online therapy sessions. Appointment fees are £80.00 (N.b. I always try to accommodate clients who have difficulty in affording my fees; I can offer reduced rates at certain times, please mention your needs when making an appointment).

I am a qualified and experienced therapist, offering effective therapy for a range of issues in a professional and confidential setting. I believe that everyone has the capacity to grow and learn and that is a principle that underpins my practice.

One to One Therapy:

I work with my clients to support them to discover who they truly are, what is important to them, how to build the future they want for themselves and to let go of difficulties. Building a relationship of trust and honesty is key to this process.

As a Certified Transactional Analyst in Psychotherapy my work is based on Transactional Analysis, which helps us uncover our unconscious beliefs and how they affect us in the ""now"".

As our therapeutic relationship develops, we jointly begin to understand how you see your life, what you would like to change, and what is getting in the way. Therapy can help you make lasting changes. This is because it offers a safe environment, as well as a new relationship - where you can experiment by interacting in different ways, be kind to yourself and account for your own needs as well as those of others.

As each individual that I see is unique, and my work will reflect you individual needs.

Training, qualifications &amp; experience

Training

I'm a fully qualified Counsellor and Transactional Analyst Psychotherapist, with a Masters Degree in TA Psychotherapy from Middlesex University

Transactional Analysis

Transactional Analysis is the theory that underpins my work. It is a psychotherapeutic approach developed by Eric Berne and is an easily understood language that helps people to make sense of their own and others' feelings, attitudes and behaviours. It also offers explanations as to how we continue to repeat patterns of behaviour that may be destructive or self-sabotaging. It is a fantastic technique for understanding how human beings work and why they relate to each other in certain ways.

Transactional Analysis looks at how you feel about the past, what you learned from your environment and how you use this in the present in relationships and life in general. By separating out what rightly belongs to the past, it is possible for you to change your future. Using TA, I share effective therapeutic models and tools with clients to clarify thoughts, explore feelings to empower and support change

Continued Professional Development (CPD)

I remain in-touch with ongoing training, research, present and future developments, and counselling literature. I have regular supervision and also attend regular training courses to keep my practice up to date

Qualifications

My qualifications to date include:

MSc in Transactional Analysis Psychotherapy
Certified Transactional Analyst
Certificate in Counselling Skills
Certificate In Coaching Skills

Experience &amp; Professional Membership(s)

Painful experiences, losses and unsatisfactory relationships can sometimes drain our emotional resources to the point where we may struggle to cope. If you find yourself in this position feeling stressed, anxious, depressed or isolated, please don’t suffer alone. Contact me. The areas that I have particular experience include relationship problems, couple / family difficulties, traumatic experiences, abuse, bullying, addictions, personality disorders, academic problems at school / university and conduct problems in children. I have helped clients work through depression, anxiety, anger, obsessions, phobias and panic which they may be experiencing as a result of their difficult experiences.
Based in Harrow I work on a brief or longer term basis providing a confidential and supportive environment where you can feel safe in sharing your problems and worries. I provide face to face counselling as well as online counselling via Skype. The integrative approach I use is adapted to your particular needs and aims to enhance your natural emotional resources. This approach considers factors that play important influences in people’s lives: relationship with parents, messages learnt from childhood, family ways of doing things, patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving as well as cultural and spiritual issues. By jointly exploring what has brought you to counselling I can help you become more aware of the different aspects of your difficulties and their particular meanings for you. Encouraging you to consider alternative perspectives and actively experiment with different ways of thinking and responding may all help you find a way forward through your challenges.
My background also makes me well placed to understand the complexity of issues faced by minority clients and the challenges linked to living and working in a country not your own. I speak English, Urdu, Hindi and French.
I am a registered provider with BUPA, AVIVA, AXA Health and Cigna (different fee schedule applies)

I provide support to children, adolescents and their families within the education sector. In addition to this, consultancy and inset day training's are available to teaching professionals wishing to learn more about children's mental health. I also have a private practice based in Dulwich, South East London.

I hold a three-year Masters in Integrative Child Psychotherapy as well as a Postgraduate Advanced Diploma in the Therapeutic Application of the Arts and a Certificate in Integrative Counselling Skills. I am a professional member of the British Association of Counsellors and Psychotherapists (MBACP) and the Institute for Arts in Therapy and Education (IATE). My affiliation with the United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP) supports the depths of my training. I adhere to their Code of Ethics; maintaining confidentiality and following relevant safeguarding procedures where necessary. I hold full professional liability insurance and an up to date DBS (Disclosures and Barring service) certificate to confirm my credibility as a competent and effective psychotherapist working with children and their families.

I respect that every child is unique and therefore brings to therapy a different set of life experiences, beliefs, and feelings. For this reason, I have an Integrative approach. This means that I draw from several theories such as attachment theory, object relations, and gestalt, underpinning it all with the latest interpersonal neurobiological research and my background in the arts. As a result, I can tailor my approach to each individual’s needs and can offer both short term or long term therapy.

The therapeutic relationship is at the heart of my practice. I understand that children and adolescents sometimes struggle to put their feelings into words and therefore I support young people to safely express their feelings by using the arts, imagination, and play. The arts allow me to gently get alongside and understand how relationships and experiences have shaped a child's internal emotional world. I help to make sense of what a child or young person shows me through their play and creativity and through their relationship with me. Therapy using the arts can help young people to gain a better understanding of themselves and others whilst building resilience and promoting emotional wellbeing."

I offer a non-judgemental, confidential space where, together, we can explore the challenges you face. As your therapist, my aim is to offer you the relationship and support you need to reflect on and be more able to cope with difficult life events. I believe therapy includes developing a deeper understanding of ourselves in the context of past and present experiences, environment and choices. I also believe we all have an innate ability to heal and that therapy can help to remove obstacles in our path – helping us shift from a life where we merely survive to one in which we develop an intention to thrive, despite life’s challenges.

The relationship between us, as therapist and client, is hugely important. As an Integrative psychotherapist, I draw on a wide range of theories, including recent developments in neurobiology, which help us understand the relationship between mind, body and our sense of safety and emotional wellbeing. Many clients benefit from developing their ability to notice what is going on in their body and being curious about this. If you feel comfortable, as well as talking, our sessions might include breathing practices, drawing and other creative ways of working that you are willing to experiment with. However, this will always be your choice.

I offer both online and face to face sessions. Face to face sessions take place in my welcoming and comfortable therapy room at home, with driveway parking.

I offer a safe and confidential place for you to talk about the difficulties you are facing. These could be new, or issues that you've struggled with for a long time. You might simply be feeling that you are not living the life you want to live, or you might be experiencing some of the following:

- anger, anxiety, bereavement, depression, relationship issues, compulsive behaviour, physical symptoms or stress.
- being cut off from your feelings and / or overwhelmed by them.
- being in a personal crisis or feeling stuck, empty or without meaning in your life.
- low self esteem or feeling like deep down, there is something wrong with you.
- trauma or other issues from your childhood.

Talking to a skilled professional can help with what feels confusing, painful or distressing.

I will listen attentively, help you to reflect on what is happening and provide guidance. This can enable you to deal with and resolve the issues at the core of the disturbance you are experiencing, as well as helping you to live a more fulfilling life.

My focus is on helping you to move towards greater choice and lasting, positive change. I will support you to find your own answers and solutions and I will tailor our sessions to meet your unique needs.

My approach is holistic in that it includes every aspect of your being (body, feelings, mind, sexuality, spirit). We all have the potential to open to the wholeness that lies at the core of our being and to live life fully.

I believe that therapy offers unique opportunities for a person to get in touch with their strengths, confidence and resilience, and in so doing equip them to deal with any challenges facing them.

I am both comfortable and experienced in offering therapy online or by phone. Accordingly, I'm experienced in supporting people struggling with anxiety and related issues.

I have experience of working with a broad range of issues and of supporting my clients to feel more positive about their lives, and bring about beneficial changes for themselves, and those around them. Your starting point might vary. Perhaps you have been feeling confused, let down, anxious, or stressed. Maybe ‘depression’ is a word that seems to fit. Or maybe you just seek more clarity and support about who you are, what you want, and how you can get there. I can help you to bring about these changes.

I enjoy my therapy practice a great deal, and value the opportunity to support my clients gain further clarity, raise awareness, and become more fully in touch with who they are, and want to be. In my experience, the therapy room is where positive changes begin.

Feel free to contact me, for an initial consultation session, to see if we might ‘fit’ in terms of how we work together. I like to see myself and my clients as a team, working to support you on your journey together. I look forward to supporting you. I see clients in a therapy studio near to Surbiton Station, and also in therapy rooms near to Fulham Broadway and Putney Bridge underground stations. I also offer Online or Telephone appointments.

My fees are:
£80 per 50 minute session.

I offer therapy tailored to the individual’s need and support people aged 18 and above.

I have experience of working with many issues, including stress, anxiety, depression, trauma, loss, sleep problems, pain, ocd and phobias. For several years I have worked in a busy Rehabilitation Centre working with Firefighters and their families aswell as Prison Officers and Ambulance Personnel. Through this work, I fully appreciate the impact of injury, long term health conditions, pain, physical and psychological trauma.

I am an Integrative Therapist which means I draw on several modalities of therapy, those being Transactional Analysis, EMDR and Solution Focussed Therapy, and I also integrate Mindfulness and CBT techniques. Creative interventions may also be introduced. There is no ‘one size fits all’ approach in therapy, and so being able to draw on a range of therapeutic approaches enables me to tailor the therapy to your needs.

Mental health issues can have an impact on our daily lives affecting our thoughts, feelings and behaviours. Daily worries can develop into longer term problems and seeking professional support can help you move through and beyond these.

I work in a non-judgemental and supportive way, giving you the protected space to explore your feelings and emotions and identify areas of change and goals. We work together aiming to achieve these, whilst I facilitate you in understanding thoughts and feelings.

One area which I am passionate about is the connection between mind and body and how they are intrinsically linked. Physical injury or a health condition can impact your mental health and mental health issues can manifest in physical issues if not addressed. So I work holistically exploring both mind and body.

In recent years, I have developed my skills and have undertaken advanced training in therapeutic approaches to trauma-related difficulties, including PTSD.
I am engaged in continuous professional development (CPD) activities, which includes supervision and advanced training.

This is with a view to you feeling better understood and better understanding yourself.

What I'd like you to know, other than that I hold the appropriate professional qualifications and insurance to practice, and that I take my role very seriously indeed, is that therapy with me is deep work that delivers lasting change. It can help you better handle the emotional and psychological distress you are facing.

In terms of practicalities - you and I will see each other weekly. I work from consulting rooms in both King's Cross and London Bridge, both in person and online. Each session runs for 50 minutes and your therapy is scheduled at the same time and day each week. My standard fee is £75 per session.

So. If you want to invest in yourself and in feeling better - let's talk.

When you feel ready, please just give me a call or email me so we can arrange to have a quick chat about how I might be able to help you. I’ll do my best to get back to you as quickly as I can. Once we’ve spoken (this call back is free of charge and usually runs for about 15 minutes), we can arrange to meet, if that feels right for both of us.

As with all my communications with you, these initial conversations will remain confidential, so should I get your voicemail when I call you, I'll just leave a very simple message, giving my name and stating that I'm responding to your enquiry."

My website aims to tell you a little about how having Psychotherapy or Counselling with me may be of help to you.
There are several types of 'Talking Therapies', and therefore it can feel overwhelming to know where to start. If you have made it this far, I imagine that you have come to a point where you feel that you might want to reflect on aspects of your life, that may be confusing, painful or uncomfortable. Perhaps you can't even describe what you are feeling or why you are feeling a certain way. But you do know that you now want things to change.
My personal and professional experience has convinced me that talking with someone trained and experienced to listen attentively - and respond to you - within a confidential, accepting and safe environment, can often be hugely beneficial. Psychotherapy and Counselling cannot erase painful past experiences. However, it can equip you to move on with greater ease, by feeling: more in charge of yourself; less engaged in internal conflict; and more able to make choices. Consequently, you will feel more able to lead a contented and productive life."

Each person's experience is different, but generally, you might seek therapy when there is something in your life you want to change and you need to explore your thoughts, feelings and actions in more depth.

In some instances, I have worked with clients in 3-6 month blocks of psychotherapy; however as the sessions progress we could find that much more needs to be looked at, in which case we might work for a year, two years or even longer.

My role is not necessarily to tell you what to do; instead, I can encourage you to talk through the problem and - looking at it from multiple perspectives - we might uncover root causes and find solutions that are specific to you.

In a safe environment, I offer - freedom to explore what you need, support to find unique understanding of your problems and helpful tools to work through them, with the aim of increased autonomy where necessary.

This is a journey that takes time and consistency for it to be effective, as a result, the clients with whom I work, choose to have regular, weekly sessions. Eventually, you can find that the process allows for increased self-understanding.

The work could also help you to appreciate another person's point of view more fully, enabling greater clarity around how you interpret words or actions of others.

My approach is Integrative - I can adapt my style of working to meet your specific needs. Also, 14 years experience as a Dramatherapist means that I can also offer creative ways of looking at difficulties where necessary.

I have experience working with a range of issues – including sexual identity, gender identity, anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, living with HIV, the long term impact of sexual abuse, bereavement and relationship difficulties.

Our first meeting will be an assessment - an opportunity to look at what might bring you to therapy and why now. If we're happy to work with each other, we can then set up a regular day and time in which work.

Each session lasts one hour and the charge is £75 per session, including initial assessments.

From the week beginning 7th October 2024 - on Tuesdays and Wednesdays - there will be 8 new slots available at 1.30pm, 3pm, 4.30pm and 6pm.

Do feel free to email me for initial enquiries.



With my very best wishes.

Haydn"

I initially completed my studies as a child practitioner and then decided to continue my training to work as an Integrative Psychotherapist with adult clients. Alongside being an avid learner, the experiential element of training has been transformative for me and I know first-hand how challenging, enlightening and healing the therapeutic relationship can be. This made me want to continue learning and growing within the therapeutic space.

I’m a qualified teacher. I worked in Further Education teaching English before re-training to become a Psychotherapist. Training alongside teaching showed me how relationship is key to healing and self-actualisation. I developed a relational approach with my students and their attendance and results improved significantly.

My background is in English. I achieved degrees in English at BA and Creative and Critical Writing at MA level at university. I thoroughly enjoyed how literature speaks to the human condition and I find that symbolism, metaphor and archetypes translate well into working with people and their therapeutic processes.

I’ve been working in the field of therapy privately and in employment with a charity since 2014. I have recently started work as an Associate Teacher on the Diploma in Integrative Psychotherapy Adult Parent Perspective at Therapy and Counselling Teesside.

I have a range of experience and knowledge in presenting issues including: attachment, complex trauma, neglect, abuse, co-dependency, separation anxiety, personality disorders, eating disorders, living with a disability, bereavement and loss, addiction, self-harm and relationships.

My particular areas of interest are attachment and the early relationship, personality adaptations and Mindful Self Compassion. I have had some Mindful Self Compassion training. I enjoyed how it can cultivate an attitude of kindness towards oneself. I intend to research these areas further in my career.

I can appreciate it can be hard to take the first step into therapy. I consider it an honour that people trust to share their internal worlds and experiences with me. I can take appointments from my therapy room in Acklam, Middlesbrough or in the Stockton, Norton or Redcar area."

You might be feeling stuck because you have tried and tried to make your relationship/marriage work. Getting through to your partner seems hopeless. You don’t want to stay in a failing marriage, but breaking up your family feels wrong too. Couple counselling is usually a starting point where you can learn about each other's needs and the way you are happy to fulfil them. You learn tools that will allow you to communicate effectively and respectfully.

Whether I work with individuals or couples my approach is simple. When I am with you, you become my centre of the universe. Whether laughing, crying, reflecting, testing or challenging yourself, you have my full attention. When I am with you I use my knowledge, skills and experience as well as common sense and intuition. My clients tend to feel at ease when working with me, frequently being surprised by the way they start to feel about themselves. Often they experience surprising and refreshing change in their perception and become aware of options and choices that open up for them.

If you are like most people, 8 sessions might give you enough knowledge and tools to deal with the challenge you are currently facing. Sometimes after 8 sessions, it might be more appropriate for you to keep in touch, monthly; to be able to adapt safely to your ""new normal"". If appropriate, you might choose to work with me long term"

I'm Alex, an experienced psychotherapist and Counsellor offering a supportive in-person space in Cornwall, South West, and online sessions for London based clients.

I hold a post graduate Diploma in Integrative Psychotherapy and have been practising since 2008. My experience includes a counselling role with the registered charity Freshstart Psychotherapy at the Centre for Counselling and Psychotherapy. There I worked with clients to tackle a range of issues such as low self- esteem, depression, relationship difficulties and meeting life goals. I've also worked in a counsellor role for the charity Mind in Enfield, a GP's practise in Paddington and at The Caravan Drop-In counselling service in Green Park, London, which serves vulnerable people in the community.

I run a private practise in Truro, Cornwall, and conduct online sessions for clients living in London and the surrounding areas.

Why seek therapy?

Everyone has their own reason for seeking someone to talk to. It might be something that seems quite tangible, like relationship problems, stress at work, bereavement, or a trauma from your past. Alternatively, it could be a general sense of unease and unhappiness, a lack of direction, and a feeling that something has to change – despite not knowing what that ""something"" is.

Talking to friends and relatives, even those closest to you, doesn't always soothe and strengthen in the way you need it too. This is where I come in. As a transpersonal therapist, my approach encompasses the ""whole you"", from your daily waking thoughts and concerns to the hidden currents of your unconscious. We'll work together at your pace, in a confidential environment, so that you can come to a new understanding of yourself and change your life for the better.

Affordability?

My usual fees start from £50.00 to £70.00. Please do feel free to email me regarding availability and with any other questions or queries you may have.

The journey

From the West Country location, I'm within easy reach of Truro train station.

Please visit my website for more information and maps.

Feeling distressed or anxious or low? Trying to understand how you feel and behave? Or perhaps you are struggling with something else in your life, trying to come to terms with your experience... I offer a confidential, respectful, sensitive space to explore what troubles you, to express yourself in a way that is rarely possible with friends, partners or family.

No feelings or thoughts are off-limits, all is welcome as we explore together at your pace, moving towards making the changes you wish for in your life.

Our work together can offer you an opportunity to deepen your self-awareness, to discover - or rediscover - aspects of yourself, your qualities and inner resources to help you face and overcome life's challenges, and to grow and to thrive. Therapy can be healing, rewarding and transformative - even enjoyable and exciting - but this comes through commitment and the building of a safe therapeutic relationship, as it can also be painful and challenging. Finding a therapist from a listing can be hard - if you would like to see if I might be the right therapist for you, please do get in touch"

I work with families, parents, carers, and their children, drawing on my expertise from various life experiences such as my medical background, working as a paediatric dentist for over 25 years, and being a father of a large family with children of various ages.
Whilst I do adopt a psychoanalytic observational stance, I don’t approach therapy from the position of an “expert”. My belief in therapy is that it focuses on awareness, understanding, and gentle support. As the word therapy suggests facilitating and serving, my work emphasises a collaborative experience, whereby I will ask you to define your own targets and goals for our work; we will then do our best to achieve them together. I offer a warm, non-judgmental, welcoming environment. I work online via Zoom, and in-person in the comfort of your own home or at my place.
I work with families of any size, couples, individuals in one-to-one sessions, parents or single parents, carers of any gender, together with their babies, infants, toddlers, or adolescents. I also work with adults, adolescents and children presenting with a variety of mental health issues such as postnatal depression, PTSD or borderline personality disorder. In addition, I address general issues concerning your child’s development such as difficulties connecting, eating, sleeping, or feeding issues and neurodiversity such as Aspergers or ASD. I accompany individuals before, during, and after pregnancy, offering prenatal and postnatal support. My main focus is the relationship between parents, carers and their children.
Within the UKCP, I am registered with the College for Child and Adolescent Psychotherapies CCAP, as well as the Council for Psychoanalysis and Jungian Analysis College CPJAC. I am also a member of the BACP and the UKCP.

I am a Parent-Infant Psychotherapist, with have nearly 15 years of experience supporting parents, babies and children.

The transition to parenthood can be very challenging. There can be too much information, advice, and pressure (!) and simultaneously a lack of reliable support or understanding. As parents, we often experience overwhelming, frequently conflicting feelings, which can be hard to bear or navigate alone (not to mention the immense physical and practical strain involved).

I am passionate about supporting parents to understand and tune into their babies and young children, and to themselves. The core part of my work is listening without judgement, and helping parents to interpret their baby’s communication and experience, which in turn allows the baby to feel heard, held and understood.

My interest and commitment to this area of work has been further fuelled by my own experience of parenthood, including perinatal anxiety and depression.

In addition to my private practice I worked for Cocoon Family Support until 2021, and continue to work with charitable services and low income families wherever possible.

Background:

In 2009, I founded and ran a charity supporting highly vulnerable parents and young children in Cambodia. We ran several early childhood development and family support programmes. Mental health was always a core component of our work.
In 2015, I started working as a birth and postnatal doula alongside my other work, offering emotional and practical support.
From September 2016 -July 2022, I trained as a Parent- Infant Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy at The School of Infant Mental Health, beginning clinical work in 2019."

Through working together,  I will listen to and hear you, support you, offer perspective, help you to get to know and understand yourself. I believe that understanding can lead to choice, and when we have choices, this can lead to change, and even lead to acceptance of what cannot be changed.

Counselling can help you process and move on from the painful feelings of the past, become more engaged with the present, and make plans and goals for the future."

I have an MSc in Gestalt Psychotherapy and a diploma in Gestalt Organisational Consulting from the Metanoia Institute, a diploma in Contemporary Trauma Practice and certificates in both couples work and clinical supervision. I continue to develop my practice through regular specialist training and supervision.

My first career was in the performing arts. This both drew on my natural ability to put myself 'in others' shoes' and honed my skill in working creatively.

In my private practice and in my experience at IAPT compliant MIND Enfield & MIND Wandsworth & Westminster, I worked with the phenomenological mode of being with my clients. I have experience as honorary CAT therapist (Cognitive- Analytic) at NHS South London & Maudsley Hospital (SLAM) where I dealt with complex secondary care clients. I was also the Talking Therapies Assessor at MIND Wandsworth & Westminster.

I provide a space where we build on our therapeutic relationship in a confidential and non-judgmental setting where you are free to talk about what you feel the need to bring up. This space is where you are accepted, safe and valued for who you are. There can be times in our life where we find it difficult to put our feelings or concerns into words and therefore need help and support from somebody external. Therefore, we will together explore the issues you raise up where your therapy is tailored toward your needs.

If you have decided to have counselling, the next step would be to arrange a meeting via email or telephone. It is important to highlight that we will start off with an initial meeting where we both can consider and sense if we want to work together, which is important when establishing our therapeutic relationship.

I offer once a week, open-ended, in person and online therapy. Some clients choose to come on a short-term basis and others for longer.

I understand that deciding to seek therapy or counselling can be a big decision. You may be experiencing worrying or difficult feelings, emotions and thoughts and may know that there is a specific issue you want to address, or you may just feel that something is wrong.

Either way, I provide a safe, non-judgemental and confidential space for you to explore whatever is troubling you. Where trust can be built, and together we can better understand what is going on and work towards healing.

I work with a range of issues relating to feelings of loss and change, sadness, anxiety, frustration, conflict and anger. Also, with the challenges of addiction, bereavement, depression, abuse, sexuality, relationships, work related problems and other issues.

Psychodynamic psychotherapy looks at how our early life experiences and relationships form patterns of behaviour and ways of being that continue to shape and influence our adult lives. You may be findings that these ways of dealing with things are no longer helpful or that you are experiencing difficulties in close relationships. This type of talking therapy can help you better understand yourself and get to the root of whatever is troubling you.

I completed a rigorous four-year postgraduate training at WPF Therapy in Psychodynamic Theory and Practice; one of the UK’s longest-standing therapy charities. I am a registered member of UKCP and am also a member of the Foundation for Psychotherapy and Counselling (FPC).

I bring the experience gained from my previous work and research to inform my way of working therapeutically, upholding the principles of inclusion, equality and safeguarding.

I hold a PGDip in Psychodynamic Psychotherapy & Counselling (University of Roehampton), a MA in Applied Theology (University of Oxford), and a BA in Theology & Religion (University of Durham).
